## üß† XGBoost/SHAP Core Capabilities

### **What is SHAP?**
**SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** provides feature importance explanations for any machine learning model prediction. It answers the crucial question: **"Why did the model make this specific prediction?"**

### **üéØ SHAP Value Types**

#### **1. Individual Record Explanations**
For each ZIP code/record, SHAP explains the prediction breakdown:

```python
# Example: Why does ZIP 10001 have 22.6% Nike preference?
base_prediction = 0.15      # Average Nike preference across all areas
+ shap_AVGHINC_CY: +0.23   # High income boosts Nike preference  
+ shap_MEDAGE_CY: +0.18    # Younger demographics help
+ shap_TOTPOP_CY: -0.12    # High density hurts slightly
+ shap_competition: +0.05   # Low Adidas presence helps
= final_prediction: 0.226   # 22.6% Nike preference
```

#### **2. Global Feature Importance**
Across all 3,983 records, which demographics matter most:

```python
global_importance = {
    'AVGHINC_CY': 0.31,      # Income is most important factor
    'MEDAGE_CY': 0.28,       # Age is second most important
    'education_level': 0.19,  # Education matters significantly
    'household_size': 0.12,   # Household composition has some impact
    'urban_density': 0.10     # Location type has minimal impact
}
```

#### **3. Feature Interaction Effects**
How features work together beyond individual contributions:

```python
# High income + Young age = extra Nike boost beyond individual effects
interaction_effect = shap_interaction_values[income_idx][age_idx]
# Result: 0.08 additional boost when both conditions are true
```
