# Simple Instructions: ArcGIS to Microservice

**Transform your ArcGIS service into a working microservice in 30-50 minutes**

## What You Need Before Starting

- **ArcGIS service URL** (example: `https://services8.arcgis.com/.../FeatureServer`)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: You must obtain this URL from your data provider or project requirements
  - The URL is specific to your data source and cannot be automatically determined
- **Target Variable** for model training
  - This is the field/column you want to predict or analyze
  - Example: `MP10128A_B_P` (Used H&R Block Online to Prepare Taxes)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: You must specify this manually based on your analysis goals
- **Computer** with internet connection
- **GitHub account** (free at github.com)
- **Render account** (free at render.com)

## Step 1: Run the Automation (2-5 minutes)

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
   - Windows: Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
   - Mac: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `terminal`, press Enter

2. **Navigate to the automation folder**
   ```
   cd path/to/your/project/scripts/automation
   ```

3. **Run the automation script**
   ```bash
   source ../venv/bin/activate
   python run_complete_automation.py "YOUR_ARCGIS_URL" --project your_project_name --target YOUR_TARGET_VARIABLE
   ```
   - Replace `YOUR_ARCGIS_URL` with your actual ArcGIS service URL  
   - Replace `your_project_name` with a simple name (no spaces)
   - Replace `YOUR_TARGET_VARIABLE` with your target field name (e.g., `MP10128A_B_P`)
   
   **Example:**
   ```bash
   python run_complete_automation.py "https://services8.arcgis.com/VhrZdFGa39zmfR47/arcgis/rest/services/Synapse54__ca07eefffe5b4914/FeatureServer" --project HRB_v2 --target MP10128A_B_P
   ```

4. **Wait for the script to run**
   - The script will automatically process your data
   - It will create models and generate files
   - **It will PAUSE** and show you instructions for the next step

## Step 2: Deploy Your Microservice (15 minutes)

When the script pauses, it will show you a message like this:
```
üö® PIPELINE PAUSE: Manual Microservice Deployment Required
üì¶ Microservice package created at: projects/your_project_name/microservice_package/
```

### 2.1 Go to Render.com

1. **Open your web browser**
2. **Go to**: <https://render.com>
3. **Sign up** for a free account (if you don't have one)
4. **Sign in** to your account

### 2.2 Create a New Web Service

1. **Click** the blue **"New"** button
2. **Select** "Web Service"
3. **Choose** "Build and deploy from a Git repository"

### 2.3 Connect Your GitHub Repository

**Option A: If you have the microservice code in GitHub:**
1. **Click "Connect"** next to your repository name
2. **Skip to Step 2.4**

**Option B: If you need to upload the code first:**
1. **Go to GitHub.com**  
2. **Create a new repository** called `your-project-microservice`
3. **Upload the files** from `projects/your_project_name/microservice_package/`
4. **Go back to Render** and connect this repository

### 2.4 Configure Your Service

**Fill in these settings exactly:**
- **Name**: `your-project-microservice`
- **Environment**: `Python 3`
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app`

### 2.5 Deploy

1. **Click** "Create Web Service"
2. **Wait** for deployment (5-10 minutes)
3. **Copy your service URL** when it's ready
   - It will look like: `https://your-project-microservice.onrender.com`

### 2.6 Test Your Microservice

1. **Open a new browser tab**
2. **Go to**: `https://your-project-microservice.onrender.com/health`
3. **You should see**: `{"status": "healthy"}`

‚úÖ **If you see this, your microservice is working!**

## Step 3: Update Your Client Code (5 minutes)

Now you need to tell your application where to find the microservice.

### 3.1 Find Your Project's Configuration

**Look for these files in your project:**
- `.env` file
- `config` folder
- Files with "microservice" or "api" in the name

### 3.2 Add Your Microservice URL

**Method 1: Add to .env file**
1. **Open** your `.env` file
2. **Add this line**:
   ```
   MICROSERVICE_URL=https://your-project-microservice.onrender.com
   ```
3. **Save** the file

**Method 2: Update config file**
1. **Find** configuration files (usually in `config/` folder)
2. **Look for** old microservice URLs
3. **Replace** them with your new URL: `https://your-project-microservice.onrender.com`

## Step 4: Test Everything (10 minutes)

### 4.1 Start Your Application

1. **Open Terminal** in your project folder
2. **Run**: `npm start` or `npm run dev` (or whatever command you normally use)

### 4.2 Test Your Application

1. **Open your application** in the browser
2. **Try loading different analysis pages**:
   - Strategic Analysis
   - Competitive Analysis
   - Demographic Analysis
3. **Check that data loads properly**
4. **Look for any error messages**

### 4.3 Check Browser Console (if needed)

1. **Press F12** in your browser
2. **Click "Console" tab**
3. **Look for any red error messages**
4. **If you see microservice errors**, double-check your URL in Step 3

## Step 5: Upload Endpoints to Blob Storage (5 minutes)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL STEP**: After generating endpoints, you must upload them to Vercel Blob storage to avoid deployment size limits and prevent conflicts with existing projects.

### 5.1 Set Up Blob Token (one-time setup)

1. **Check if token exists**:
   ```bash
   grep BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN .env.local
   ```

2. **If not found, add it**:
   ```bash
   echo "BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token" >> .env.local
   ```

### 5.2 Upload Project-Specific Files to Blob Storage (Optional - Automated)

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE**: The automation pipeline (Phase 8) automatically uploads both endpoints and boundary files to blob storage if BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN is configured. This step is **optional** for manual uploads.

1. **Manual upload if needed**:
   ```bash
   export BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=$(grep BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN .env.local | cut -d= -f2)
   python upload_comprehensive_endpoints.py
   ```

2. **Verify successful upload**:
   - Look for: `‚úÖ All endpoints and boundary files successfully uploaded to blob storage!`
   - Check created file: `public/data/blob-urls-{project_name}.json`
   - Geographic visualizations will now load boundary data from blob storage

### 5.3 Update Data Loader for New Project

**CRITICAL**: Update the system to use your new project's blob URLs:

1. **Edit** `utils/blob-data-loader.ts`
2. **Change the blob URLs file path**:
   ```typescript
   // FROM (old project):
   const response = await fetch('/data/blob-urls.json');
   const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'public/data/blob-urls.json');
   
   // TO (your new project):
   const response = await fetch('/data/blob-urls-{project_name}.json');
   const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'public/data/blob-urls-{project_name}.json');
   ```

### 5.4 Why This Step is Critical

- **Size Limits**: Prevents 100MB+ deployment failures (boundary files are typically 5-50MB)
- **Project Separation**: Keeps your data separate from other projects
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures correct data loads for your analysis
- **Performance**: Blob storage provides faster data access for large boundary files
- **Geographic Visualization**: Boundary files enable choropleth maps and spatial filtering

**üö® WARNING**: Skipping this step will cause:
- Wrong data to load (from previous projects)
- Spatial filtering failures (ID mismatches)
- Zero records returned from queries
- Broken geographic visualizations without boundary files

## Step 6: Automation Continues Automatically (1 minute)

1. **The automation continues automatically** after the pause
2. **It will complete all remaining phases**:
   - **Phase 6.5**: Update field mappings with current project data
   - **Phase 6.6**: Verify boundary file requirements for spatial analysis
   - **Phase 7**: Create TypeScript layer configurations  
   - **Phase 8**: Final integration and deployment:
     - Generate 26 analysis endpoints (19 standard + 7 comprehensive)
     - Apply 22 comprehensive scoring algorithms
     - **Upload endpoints and boundary files to blob storage** (if BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN available)
     - Deploy all files to your application
     - Update layer configurations
   - **Optional**: AI synonym expansion for enhanced natural language queries
   - **Cleanup**: Offer storage optimization recommendations
3. **You'll see**: `üéâ AUTOMATION PIPELINE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!`

### üóÇÔ∏è New: Automatic Field Mapping Updates

The automation now includes **Phase 6.5: Field Mapping Update** which:

- **Discovers all unique fields** from your endpoint data (132+ fields)
- **Generates comprehensive aliases** for natural language queries
- **Creates human-readable display names** for UI components
- **Synchronizes mappings** with your actual project data
- **Eliminates outdated references** from previous projects

**Benefits:**

- üéØ **Accurate field resolution** - No more missing field errors
- üó£Ô∏è **Better natural language processing** - Users can type "population" and get results
- üé® **Consistent UI labels** - All popups and legends show proper field names
- üîÑ **Always current** - Mappings update automatically with your data
- ü§ñ **AI Enhancement Ready** - Optional 500+ synonym expansion for semantic queries

üìñ **For detailed information**, see the [Field Mapping Automation Documentation](../../docs/FIELD_MAPPING_AUTOMATION.md) which explains:

- How the field discovery system works
- Manual maintenance procedures
- Field categorization and naming conventions
- Troubleshooting common mapping issues

### ü§ñ Step 6.6: AI-Powered Synonym Expansion (Optional Enhancement)

**‚ö†Ô∏è FOR AI ASSISTANTS**: This step dramatically improves natural language query capabilities by expanding field-aliases.ts with comprehensive synonyms.

**When to perform this step:**
- After Phase 6.5 (Field Mapping Update) completes
- When users report difficulty finding fields with natural language queries
- To enhance user experience with semantic field discovery

**AI Instructions for Synonym Expansion:**

#### 1. **Analyze Field Definitions** (Required Reading)
```bash
# Read the layers.ts file to understand what each field actually represents
cat /config/layers.ts
```

**Key sections to examine:**
- **Layer names** (lines ~226, 335, 444, etc.): "Generation Alpha Pop", "Used Google Pay Digital Payment Svc"
- **Field aliases** in each layer's fields array: `"alias": "2025 Used Apple Pay Digital Payment Service Last 30 Days"`
- **Field descriptions**: Full context of what each MP code, X code represents

#### 2. **Field Categories and Meanings**
Based on layers.ts analysis, you'll typically find:

**Business/Consumer Behavior Fields:**
- Service usage patterns (e.g., "Used [Service] Last 30 Days")
- Financial product ownership (e.g., "Have [Product]", "Own [Investment]")
- Consumer preferences and behaviors
- Digital service adoption patterns

**Asset/Economic Value Fields:**
- Financial asset values (e.g., "Value of [Asset Type]")
- Income and spending data
- Investment portfolio information
- Debt and liability amounts

**Demographic Fields:**
- Age groups and generations
- Population segments
- Geographic distributions
- Household characteristics

#### 3. **Implementation Process**

**Step A: Open field-aliases.ts**
```bash
# Edit the field aliases file
nano /utils/field-aliases.ts
```

**Step B: Expand Each Category with Natural Language Synonyms**

For each field category, add 5-15 natural language variations. **Examples based on field meanings:**

```typescript
// Example: Digital Payment Service Field - ADD SYNONYMS LIKE:
"[service name]": "[FIELD_CODE]",
"used [service]": "[FIELD_CODE]", 
"digital payment": "[FIELD_CODE]",
"mobile payment": "[FIELD_CODE]",
"contactless payment": "[FIELD_CODE]",
"[service] wallet": "[FIELD_CODE]",
"[device] payment": "[FIELD_CODE]",

// Example: Investment/Asset Value Field - ADD SYNONYMS LIKE:
"stocks": "[ASSET_FIELD]",
"bonds": "[ASSET_FIELD]", 
"mutual funds": "[ASSET_FIELD]",
"investments": "[ASSET_FIELD]",
"portfolio": "[ASSET_FIELD]",
"retirement": "[ASSET_FIELD]",
"wealth": "[ASSET_FIELD]",
```

**Step C: Add Cross-Category Natural Language Aliases**
```typescript
// === NATURAL LANGUAGE ALIASES ===
// Map broad concepts to most relevant specific fields based on your data
// Examples (adapt to your project's actual fields):

// Financial concepts ‚Üí relevant financial fields
"wealth": "[INVESTMENT_FIELD]",     // ‚Üí investment/asset values
"money": "[CASH_FIELD]",            // ‚Üí liquid asset fields  
"debt": "[DEBT_FIELD]",             // ‚Üí debt/liability fields
"banking": "[BANKING_FIELD]",       // ‚Üí banking service fields

// Technology concepts ‚Üí relevant tech adoption fields
"digital": "[DIGITAL_SERVICE]",     // ‚Üí digital service usage
"mobile": "[MOBILE_SERVICE]",       // ‚Üí mobile app/payment usage
"tech": "[TECH_ADOPTION]",          // ‚Üí technology adoption fields

// Demographic concepts ‚Üí relevant population fields
"young": "[YOUNG_DEMO_FIELD]",      // ‚Üí younger demographic field
"population": "[PRIMARY_DEMO]",     // ‚Üí primary population field
"people": "[PRIMARY_DEMO]",         // ‚Üí primary population field
```

#### 4. **Quality Guidelines**

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Use the exact field meanings from layers.ts aliases
- Add 5-15 synonyms per major field
- Include common abbreviations (e.g., "boa" for Bank of America)
- Add industry terms (e.g., "fintech" for digital payments)
- Include related concepts (e.g., "portfolio" for investments)

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Create duplicate keys (check for conflicts)
- Add synonyms that don't match the field's actual meaning
- Use overly broad terms that could map to multiple fields
- Include offensive or inappropriate terms

#### 5. **Testing and Validation**

**Check for TypeScript errors:**
```bash
npm run typecheck
```

**Count your improvements:**
```bash
echo "Total aliases: $(grep -c '"[^"]*":' /utils/field-aliases.ts)"
echo "Unique fields: $(grep -o '": "[^"]*"' /utils/field-aliases.ts | sort | uniq | wc -l)"
```

**Target metrics:**
- **500+ total aliases** (vs ~30 original)
- **90+ unique field mappings**
- **No TypeScript duplicate key errors**

#### 6. **Expected Impact**

After expansion, users can query with natural language based on your project's data:
- **"Show me [service/product] users"** ‚Üí Service adoption fields
- **"[Service A] users vs [Service B] accounts"** ‚Üí Comparative analysis
- **"Young people with [technology/service]"** ‚Üí Demographic + behavioral fields
- **"Wealth distribution analysis"** ‚Üí Financial asset fields
- **"[Financial metric] by area"** ‚Üí Geographic distribution analysis

**Success Criteria:**
- üéØ **17x improvement** in natural language query support
- üó£Ô∏è **Semantic understanding** of user intent
- üöÄ **Dramatically improved UX** for non-technical users

## Step 6.7: Boundary File Verification (Automatic)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL STEP**: Geographic boundary files are required for spatial analysis and choropleth mapping. The automation now includes **Phase 6.6: Boundary File Verification** which:

- **Checks for existing boundary files** in `public/data/boundaries/`
- **Looks for ZIP code and FSA boundaries** (`zip_boundaries.json`, `fsa_boundaries.json`)
- **Reports file sizes** if boundary files are found
- **Issues detailed alerts** if boundary files are missing
- **Continues with warning** rather than failing the pipeline

### What Are Boundary Files?

**Boundary files contain GeoJSON data that defines geographic regions for spatial analysis:**

- **ZIP Code Boundaries** (`zip_boundaries.json`): US postal code geographic boundaries
- **FSA Boundaries** (`fsa_boundaries.json`): Canadian Forward Sortation Area boundaries
- **Format**: GeoJSON with polygon geometries and postal/FSA code properties
- **Purpose**: Enable choropleth mapping, spatial filtering, and geographic analysis

### Why Are They Important?

**Without boundary files, your application will:**
- ‚ùå **Fail to render choropleth maps** (colored regions based on data values)
- ‚ùå **Cannot perform spatial filtering** (e.g., "show data for specific ZIP codes")
- ‚ùå **Show empty or broken visualizations** for geographic analysis
- ‚ùå **Return zero results** for location-based queries

### Automation Boundary Check

**Phase 6.6 automatically:**

1. **Scans boundary directory**: `public/data/boundaries/`
2. **Checks for required files**:
   - `zip_boundaries.json` (US ZIP codes)
   - `fsa_boundaries.json` (Canadian FSAs)
3. **Reports file status**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Found boundary file: zip_boundaries.json (15.2 MB)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Missing boundary file: fsa_boundaries.json
   ```
4. **Issues alerts with solutions** if files are missing

### If Boundary Files Are Missing

**When boundary files are missing, you'll see:**

```
üö® BOUNDARY FILE ALERT: Critical geographic data missing

‚ùå Missing: public/data/boundaries/zip_boundaries.json
‚ùå Missing: public/data/boundaries/fsa_boundaries.json

üìã BOUNDARY FILE REQUIREMENTS:
   ‚Ä¢ ZIP Boundaries: Required for US postal code mapping
   ‚Ä¢ FSA Boundaries: Required for Canadian postal code mapping
   ‚Ä¢ Without these files, geographic visualizations will fail

üîß SOLUTIONS:
   1. Download from Statistics Canada: https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-eng.cfm
   2. Download US ZIP boundaries: https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php
   3. Contact your data provider for boundary files
   4. Use third-party services like Natural Earth Data

‚ö†Ô∏è  Continuing automation with BOUNDARY FILE WARNING
```

### How to Obtain Boundary Files

**For Canadian FSA Boundaries:**
1. **Statistics Canada**: https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-eng.cfm
2. **Download postal code boundary files**
3. **Convert to GeoJSON format** if needed
4. **Place in**: `public/data/boundaries/fsa_boundaries.json`

**For US ZIP Code Boundaries:**
1. **US Census Bureau**: https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php
2. **Download ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA)**
3. **Convert shapefiles to GeoJSON**
4. **Place in**: `public/data/boundaries/zip_boundaries.json`

**Third-party Sources:**
- **Natural Earth Data**: Free vector and raster map data
- **OpenStreetMap**: Community-generated boundary data
- **Commercial providers**: Esri, MapBox, Google

### File Format Requirements

**Boundary files must be valid GeoJSON with:**

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "POSTAL_CODE": "M5V", // For FSA boundaries
        "ZCTA5CE10": "10001"  // For ZIP boundaries
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [[[lat, lng], [lat, lng], ...]]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key requirements:**
- **Valid GeoJSON structure** with FeatureCollection
- **Polygon geometries** defining geographic boundaries  
- **Postal code properties** for matching with analysis data
- **Consistent property names** across all features
- **File size**: Typically 5-50MB depending on detail level

### Testing Boundary Integration

**After adding boundary files:**

1. **Restart your application**
2. **Navigate to geographic analysis pages**
3. **Verify choropleth maps render correctly**
4. **Test spatial filtering functionality**
5. **Check browser console for geographic errors**

**Success indicators:**
- ‚úÖ **Colored regions appear** on maps based on data values
- ‚úÖ **Hover tooltips show** postal codes and data values
- ‚úÖ **Spatial filtering works** (e.g., "show only high-value areas")
- ‚úÖ **No console errors** related to missing boundary data

## Step 8: Optional Storage Cleanup (1 minute)

After completion, you'll see cleanup recommendations:

```bash
üßπ CLEANUP RECOMMENDATION
üìä Current project size: 45.2 MB
üí° CLEANUP OPTIONS:
   1. Run cleanup now (dry-run first):
      python scripts/automation/cleanup_automation_artifacts.py --dry-run
```

**To optimize storage:**
1. **Preview what will be cleaned**: Run the dry-run command first
2. **Run actual cleanup**: Remove `--dry-run` to delete files
