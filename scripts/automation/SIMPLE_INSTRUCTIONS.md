# Simple Instructions: ArcGIS to Microservice

**Transform your ArcGIS service into a working microservice in 30-50 minutes**

## What You Need Before Starting

- **ArcGIS service URL** (example: `https://services8.arcgis.com/.../FeatureServer`)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: You must obtain this URL from your data provider or project requirements
  - The URL is specific to your data source and cannot be automatically determined
- **Target Variable** for model training
  - This is the field/column you want to predict or analyze
  - Example: `MP10128A_B_P` (Used H&R Block Online to Prepare Taxes)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: You must specify this manually based on your analysis goals
- **Computer** with internet connection
- **GitHub account** (free at github.com)
- **Render account** (free at render.com)

## Step 1: Run the Automation (2-5 minutes)

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
   - Windows: Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
   - Mac: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `terminal`, press Enter

2. **Navigate to the automation folder**
   ```
   cd path/to/your/project/scripts/automation
   ```

3. **Run the automation script**
   ```bash
   source ../venv/bin/activate
   python run_complete_automation.py "YOUR_ARCGIS_URL" --project your_project_name --target YOUR_TARGET_VARIABLE
   ```
   - Replace `YOUR_ARCGIS_URL` with your actual ArcGIS service URL  
   - Replace `your_project_name` with a simple name (no spaces)
   - Replace `YOUR_TARGET_VARIABLE` with your target field name (e.g., `MP10128A_B_P`)
   
   **Example:**
   ```bash
   python run_complete_automation.py "https://services8.arcgis.com/VhrZdFGa39zmfR47/arcgis/rest/services/Synapse54__ca07eefffe5b4914/FeatureServer" --project HRB_v2 --target MP10128A_B_P
   ```

4. **Wait for the script to run**
   - The script will automatically process your data
   - It will create models and generate files
   - **It will PAUSE** and show you instructions for the next step

## Step 2: Deploy Your Microservice (15 minutes)

When the script pauses, it will show you a message like this:
```
üö® PIPELINE PAUSE: Manual Microservice Deployment Required
üì¶ Microservice package created at: projects/your_project_name/microservice_package/
```

### 2.1 Go to Render.com

1. **Open your web browser**
2. **Go to**: <https://render.com>
3. **Sign up** for a free account (if you don't have one)
4. **Sign in** to your account

### 2.2 Create a New Web Service

1. **Click** the blue **"New"** button
2. **Select** "Web Service"
3. **Choose** "Build and deploy from a Git repository"

### 2.3 Connect Your GitHub Repository

**Option A: If you have the microservice code in GitHub:**
1. **Click "Connect"** next to your repository name
2. **Skip to Step 2.4**

**Option B: If you need to upload the code first:**
1. **Go to GitHub.com**  
2. **Create a new repository** called `your-project-microservice`
3. **Upload the files** from `projects/your_project_name/microservice_package/`
4. **Go back to Render** and connect this repository

### 2.4 Configure Your Service

**Fill in these settings exactly:**
- **Name**: `your-project-microservice`
- **Environment**: `Python 3`
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT app:app`

### 2.5 Deploy

1. **Click** "Create Web Service"
2. **Wait** for deployment (5-10 minutes)
3. **Copy your service URL** when it's ready
   - It will look like: `https://your-project-microservice.onrender.com`

### 2.6 Test Your Microservice

1. **Open a new browser tab**
2. **Go to**: `https://your-project-microservice.onrender.com/health`
3. **You should see**: `{"status": "healthy"}`

‚úÖ **If you see this, your microservice is working!**

## Step 3: Update Your Client Code (5 minutes)

Now you need to tell your application where to find the microservice.

### 3.1 Find Your Project's Configuration

**Look for these files in your project:**
- `.env` file
- `config` folder
- Files with "microservice" or "api" in the name

### 3.2 Add Your Microservice URL

**Method 1: Add to .env file**
1. **Open** your `.env` file
2. **Add this line**:
   ```
   MICROSERVICE_URL=https://your-project-microservice.onrender.com
   ```
3. **Save** the file

**Method 2: Update config file**
1. **Find** configuration files (usually in `config/` folder)
2. **Look for** old microservice URLs
3. **Replace** them with your new URL: `https://your-project-microservice.onrender.com`

## Step 4: Test Everything (10 minutes)

### 4.1 Start Your Application

1. **Open Terminal** in your project folder
2. **Run**: `npm start` or `npm run dev` (or whatever command you normally use)

### 4.2 Test Your Application

1. **Open your application** in the browser
2. **Try loading different analysis pages**:
   - Strategic Analysis
   - Competitive Analysis
   - Demographic Analysis
3. **Check that data loads properly**
4. **Look for any error messages**

### 4.3 Check Browser Console (if needed)

1. **Press F12** in your browser
2. **Click "Console" tab**
3. **Look for any red error messages**
4. **If you see microservice errors**, double-check your URL in Step 3

## Step 5: Automation Continues Automatically (1 minute)

1. **The automation continues automatically** after the pause
2. **It will complete all remaining phases**:
   - Generate 26 analysis endpoints (19 standard + 7 comprehensive)
   - Apply 22 comprehensive scoring algorithms  
   - Create TypeScript layer configurations
   - Deploy all files to your application
   - Offer cleanup recommendations to optimize storage
3. **You'll see**: `üéâ AUTOMATION PIPELINE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!`

## Step 6: Optional Storage Cleanup (1 minute)

After completion, you'll see cleanup recommendations:

```
üßπ CLEANUP RECOMMENDATION
üìä Current project size: 45.2 MB
üí° CLEANUP OPTIONS:
   1. Run cleanup now (dry-run first):
      python scripts/automation/cleanup_automation_artifacts.py --dry-run
```

**To optimize storage:**
1. **Preview what will be cleaned**: Run the dry-run command first
2. **Run actual cleanup**: Remove `--dry-run` to delete files
3. **Keep your system tidy**: The cleanup removes old projects, temporary files, and duplicates

## What You Get

After completing all steps, you'll have:

‚úÖ **Complete microservice** running on Render with 17 specialized AI models

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Script won't run
- **Solution**: Make sure you're in the right folder, activate the virtual environment with `source ../venv/bin/activate`, and have the required Python packages installed

**Problem**: Target variable not found error
- **Solution**: The target variable must match exactly the column name in your data. Check your data source documentation for available fields

**Problem**: Render deployment fails
- **Solution**: Check that all files were uploaded correctly to GitHub

**Problem**: Application can't connect to microservice
- **Solution**: Double-check the microservice URL in your configuration files

**Problem**: Data doesn't load in your application
- **Solution**: Wait a few minutes for Render to fully start up, then try again

## Getting Help

**If you're stuck:**
1. **Check** the error messages carefully
2. **Look** at the automation logs in `projects/your_project_name/`
3. **Verify** each step was completed correctly
4. **Try** restarting your application after making changes
