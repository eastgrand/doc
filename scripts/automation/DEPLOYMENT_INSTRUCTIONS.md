# Complete Microservice Deployment Instructions

🚀 **Step-by-step guide for deploying your ArcGIS-generated microservice to Render**

## 🚨 **PROCESS IMPROVEMENT NOTES** (Added 2025-08-10)

### Issues Encountered During HRB Project Deployment:

**Issue 1: Automation Pipeline Continuation**
- **Problem**: Automation continued automatically instead of pausing for microservice deployment
- **Impact**: Datasets generated without SHAP values from live microservice, resulting in incomplete scoring
- **Root Cause**: Pipeline didn't wait for manual microservice deployment step
- **Solution Applied**: Manually deployed microservice, then will re-run automation with `--continue-after-microservice` flag
- **Process Improvement Needed**: Modify `run_complete_automation.py` to properly pause and wait for confirmation that microservice is deployed before continuing

**Issue 2: Repository Access Method** 
- **Problem**: Instructions suggested forking existing microservice, but we used existing `shap-microservice` repo
- **Reality**: We updated existing `shap-microservice` repository instead of forking
- **Solution Applied**: Copied HRB package files to existing microservice structure
- **Process Improvement**: Update instructions to clarify both options clearly

**Issue 3: File Structure Mapping**
- **Problem**: HRB automation generated different file names than expected by microservice
- **Generated Files**: `model.joblib`, `features.json`, `training_data.csv`
- **Expected Files**: `xgboost_model.pkl`, `feature_names.txt`, `nesto_merge_0.csv`
- **Solution Applied**: Manual file mapping and conversion during copy process
- **Process Improvement Needed**: Modify automation to generate files with correct names for microservice

**Issue 4: Missing Dependencies**
- **Problem**: Generated package missing `joblib` dependency for .joblib files
- **Solution Applied**: Added `joblib==1.3.2` to requirements.txt
- **Process Improvement**: Update microservice package generator to include all required dependencies

### Recommended Automation Improvements:

1. **Add Proper Pause Mechanism**: Modify automation to wait for user confirmation before continuing
2. **Standardize File Names**: Generate files with names expected by microservice
3. **Complete Dependency Detection**: Auto-detect and include all required Python packages
4. **Repository Template**: Create cleaner template/fork process for new projects
5. **Validation Steps**: Add checks to verify microservice is running before continuing pipeline

### Successful Workarounds Applied:
- Manual file structure mapping during deployment
- Proper git commit and push to trigger Render deployment
- Direct repository update instead of forking process

## 📋 Overview

After the automation pipeline creates your microservice package, you need to:
1. **Deploy the microservice to Render** (15-20 minutes) 
2. **Update your client code** with the new microservice URL (5 minutes)
3. **Re-run automation continuation** to get proper SHAP-based scoring (if pipeline completed prematurely)

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT READY** (2025-08-10)

✅ **If all tests pass, your microservice is deployed successfully!**

## 🔧 Step 2: Update Client Code

Now update your client application to use the new microservice.

### 2.1 Add Environment Variable

**Method A: .env file (Recommended)**
```bash
# Add to your .env file
echo "MICROSERVICE_URL=https://your-project-microservice.onrender.com" >> .env
```

**Method B: System environment**
```bash
# Add to your shell profile
export MICROSERVICE_URL=https://your-project-microservice.onrender.com
```

### 2.2 Update Configuration Files

**Find existing microservice references:**
```bash
# Search for hardcoded URLs
grep -r "microservice" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.tsx"
grep -r "onrender.com" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.tsx"
grep -r "shap-microservice" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.tsx"
```

**Update configuration files:**

**Option A: Create/update config file**
```typescript
// config/microservice.ts
export const MICROSERVICE_CONFIG = {
  baseUrl: process.env.MICROSERVICE_URL || 'https://your-project-microservice.onrender.com',
  timeout: 30000,
  retries: 3
};
```

**Option B: Update existing config**
```typescript
// Find files like utils/constants.ts, config/api.ts, etc.
// Replace old URLs with:
const MICROSERVICE_BASE_URL = process.env.MICROSERVICE_URL || 'https://your-project-microservice.onrender.com';
```

### 2.3 Update API Calls

**Find and update API calls:**
```typescript
// Before:
const response = await fetch('https://old-microservice.onrender.com/predict', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(data)
});

// After:
import { MICROSERVICE_CONFIG } from '../config/microservice';

const response = await fetch(`${MICROSERVICE_CONFIG.baseUrl}/predict`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(data)
});
```

### 2.4 Test Integration

```bash
# 1. Start your development server
npm run dev

```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: Microservice won't deploy**
```bash
# Check Render build logs
# Common fixes:
# - Verify requirements.txt has correct versions
# - Check that all model files were uploaded
# - Ensure gunicorn command is correct
```

**Issue 2: Client can't connect to microservice**
```bash
# Check CORS settings in microservice
# Verify environment variable is set correctly
# Check browser network tab for blocked requests
```

**Issue 3: SHAP calculations fail**
```bash
# Verify model files are correctly uploaded
# Check microservice logs in Render
# Test with smaller data samples first
```

**Issue 4: Slow response times**
```bash
# Consider upgrading Render plan
# Optimize model loading (cache models in memory)
# Implement request batching if needed
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check Render Logs**: Go to your service dashboard and check logs
2. **Test Endpoints**: Use curl to test individual endpoints
3. **Browser Console**: Check for JavaScript errors in client
