# ML Service Status Report

## Service Status Summary

✅ **Service is running**: The service is deployed and responding to basic health checks.

✅ **Redis connection**: Redis connectivity is working correctly. The health check confirms Redis status is "ok".

❌ **Models are not loading**: The service shows model status as "error" with no loaded models.

❌ **Authentication issues**: Unable to access authenticated endpoints (prediction, diagnostics, redis-reconnect).

## Details

### What Works

- **Basic Endpoints**: `/ping` and `/api/health` endpoints are working correctly
- **Redis Connection**: The Redis connection to Upstash is working correctly
- **Service Deployment**: The service is deployed and running in "degraded" mode

### What Doesn't Work

- **Model Loading**: Models are not being loaded during service startup
- **Authentication**: We are unable to authenticate with the provided API keys
- **Prediction Functionality**: Due to both authentication and model issues, prediction isn't working

## Root Cause Analysis

### Redis Connection Issue (FIXED)
- Problem: JavaScript-style regex was used in Python code
- Fix: Updated to Python's `re.sub()` syntax
- Result: Redis now connects successfully

### Model Loading Issue
- Most likely causes:
  1. The `load_models()` function may not be called during startup
  2. There might be an exception during model loading
  3. The models might be designed to be loaded by the worker service instead
  4. Model files might be missing from the expected directory

### Authentication Issue
- The API key is not being accepted by the service
- This could be due to:
  1. The API key environment variable not being set correctly in Render
  2. The API key being different than what we're trying

## Next Steps

1. **Check Service Logs**:
   - Review the Render logs for any exceptions during model loading
   - Look for authentication-related messages

2. **Model Loading Fix**:
   - Verify that models exist in the expected directory
   - Check if `load_models()` is called from the main startup code
   - Consider adding explicit exception handling around model loading

3. **Authentication Fix**:
   - Verify the correct API key in the Render dashboard
   - Check the code for any special API key handling

4. **Service Architecture**:
   - Confirm if model loading is supposed to happen in the worker service
   - Review the relationships between the web service and worker service

## Conclusion

The Redis connection issue has been successfully resolved. The service is now running but in a degraded state due to model loading and authentication problems. The application can accept basic health check requests but cannot perform its core ML functionality until these issues are resolved.
