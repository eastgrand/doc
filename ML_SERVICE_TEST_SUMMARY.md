# ML Microservice Test Summary

## Test Results

We've performed comprehensive testing of the ML microservice and identified several issues that need to be addressed. Here's a summary of our findings:

### 1. Service Status

✅ **Ping Endpoint**: Working correctly (`/ping`)
❌ **Health Endpoint**: Failing with 500 error (`/api/health`)
❌ **Prediction Endpoint**: Failing with 500 error (`/api/predict`)

### 2. Redis Connectivity

We were unable to verify Redis connectivity because the service is returning 500 errors. Based on our tests, this is likely due to one of the following issues:

- Missing or incorrect Redis environment variables
- Network connectivity issues between Render and Upstash
- Authentication issues with the Redis service
- Redis service availability or connection limits

## Recommended Actions

To resolve these issues, we recommend the following steps in order of priority:

### 1. Verify Redis Configuration

1. **Check Redis environment variables** in the Render dashboard:
   - REDIS_URL (must be correctly formatted: `redis://username:password@host:port`)
   - REDIS_TIMEOUT (recommend setting to at least 10 seconds)
   - REDIS_SOCKET_KEEPALIVE (should be 'true')
   - REDIS_CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE (recommend 10-20)

2. **Run Redis diagnostics** directly in the Render shell:
   - Copy and paste the entire content of `redis-diagnostic-tool/inline_redis_test.js` into the service shell
   - This will test connectivity and identify specific Redis issues

### 2. Check Service Logs

1. **Examine error logs** in the Render dashboard:
   - Look for specific error messages related to Redis connectivity
   - Check for any other errors that might be causing the 500 status

### 3. Update Redis Client Configuration

If connectivity issues persist, try these configuration adjustments:

1. **Increase timeouts**:
   ```
   REDIS_TIMEOUT=15
   REDIS_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=30
   ```

2. **Enable retry on timeout**:
   ```
   REDIS_RETRY_ON_TIMEOUT=true
   ```

3. **Adjust health check interval**:
   ```
   REDIS_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=60
   ```

### 4. Testing Tools

We've provided several tools to help diagnose and fix these issues:

1. **Inline Redis Tests**:
   - `redis-diagnostic-tool/inline_redis_test.js` - JavaScript version
   - `redis-diagnostic-tool/inline_redis_test.py` - Python version

2. **Local Testing**:
   - `local-redis-test.js` - Test Redis connectivity from your local machine
   - Run with `--diagnose --verbose` flags for detailed diagnostics

3. **Redis Diagnostic API**:
   - `redis-diagnostic-api.js` - Standalone service for persistent monitoring
   - Deployment instructions in `redis-diagnostic-tool/deploy-instructions.md`

### 5. Possible Service Updates

If all else fails, these more significant changes might be necessary:

1. **Implement fallback mechanism**:
   - Update service to gracefully handle Redis failures
   - Add a feature flag to disable Redis-dependent features

2. **Review Redis usage patterns**:
   - Check for resource-intensive operations
   - Consider implementing batching or rate limiting

3. **Consider alternative Redis providers**:
   - If Upstash is consistently problematic, consider alternatives
   - Test with a different Redis service to isolate provider-specific issues

## Next Steps

After implementing the recommended changes, run the comprehensive test suite again to verify the fixes:

```bash
python3 ml-service-test.py --url https://nesto-mortgage-analytics.onrender.com --api-key HFqkccbN3LV5CaB
```

This will generate a detailed report of service functionality and Redis connectivity.
