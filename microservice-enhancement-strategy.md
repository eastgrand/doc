# MPIQ AI Chat Microservice Enhancement Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for improving the MPIQ AI Chat system by enhancing the data export approach and expanding microservice functionality to provide richer analytical capabilities.

## Current System Issues

### Export System Problems
1. **Single Export Limitation**: Current export tries to fit all brands into one correlation analysis
2. **Missing Target Variables**: Only Nike data (`mp30034a_b_p`) appears in exports, missing Adidas, Jordan, etc.
3. **No Field Metadata**: Cryptic field names like `thematic_value_39` have no human-readable descriptions
4. **Analysis Type Mismatch**: Using "correlation" analysis type when frontend uses `topN`, `ranking`, etc.

### Data Understanding Gap
- AI doesn't know what fields mean in business context
- No categorization of demographic vs psychographic vs geographic data
- Missing value ranges and statistical context
- No explanations of business relevance

## Recommended Solution: Target-Specific Exports

### 1. Individual Brand Exports

Instead of one monolithic export, create separate comprehensive exports for each target variable:

```
/data/exports/
├── nike-comprehensive.json          # All Nike analysis data
├── adidas-comprehensive.json        # All Adidas analysis data  
├── jordan-comprehensive.json        # All Jordan analysis data
├── new-balance-comprehensive.json   # All New Balance analysis data
├── puma-comprehensive.json          # All Puma analysis data
├── reebok-comprehensive.json        # All Reebok analysis data
├── converse-comprehensive.json      # All Converse analysis data
└── asics-comprehensive.json         # All Asics analysis data
```

### 2. Enhanced Export Structure

Each export should contain:

```json
{
  "brand_info": {
    "name": "Nike",
    "target_field": "MP30034A_B_P",
    "canonical_name": "mp30034a_b_p",
    "description": "Nike athletic footwear purchase penetration by postal area"
  },
  "field_metadata": {
    "thematic_value_39": {
      "description": "Urban fitness lifestyle segment penetration",
      "category": "psychographic_segment",
      "data_type": "percentage",
      "business_meaning": "Areas with high concentration of urban fitness enthusiasts",
      "value_range": {"min": 0, "max": 100, "mean": 12.5}
    }
  },
  "geographic_data": [...],
  "shap_analysis": {
    "factor_importance": [...],
    "feature_interactions": [...],
    "scenario_analysis": [...],
    "threshold_analysis": [...],
    "outlier_analysis": [...]
  }
}
```

## Current Microservice SHAP Capabilities

Based on the current `app.py`, the microservice already provides these SHAP-powered endpoints:

### 1. Factor Importance (`/factor-importance`)
- **What it provides**: SHAP values showing which features most influence target variable
- **Business value**: "What demographic factors predict high Nike sales?"
- **Data**: Feature rankings, SHAP values, example areas, correlations

### 2. Feature Interactions (`/feature-interactions`) 
- **What it provides**: SHAP interaction values between feature pairs
- **Business value**: "How do income and education work together to influence brand preference?"
- **Data**: Interaction strength, synergistic/antagonistic relationships, example areas

### 3. Outlier Detection (`/outlier-detection`)
- **What it provides**: SHAP explanations for statistically unusual areas
- **Business value**: "Why is this area performing unexpectedly well/poorly?"
- **Data**: Outlier scores, SHAP explanations, contributing factors

### 4. Scenario Analysis (`/scenario-analysis`)
- **What it provides**: SHAP-based "what-if" predictions
- **Business value**: "How would increasing income by 15% affect Nike sales?"
- **Data**: Predicted impacts, SHAP contributions, feasibility assessments

### 5. Threshold Analysis (`/threshold-analysis`) 
- **What it provides**: SHAP values across feature value ranges
- **Business value**: "At what income level does Nike preference significantly increase?"
- **Data**: Inflection points, optimal thresholds, impact curves

### 6. Segment Profiling (`/segment-profiling`)
- **What it provides**: SHAP explanations for different performance segments
- **Business value**: "What makes high-performing areas different from low-performing ones?"
- **Data**: Segment characteristics, distinguishing features, SHAP profiles

### 7. Comparative Analysis (`/comparative-analysis`)
- **What it provides**: SHAP explanations for differences between groups
- **Business value**: "How do urban vs rural Nike preferences differ?"
- **Data**: Group comparisons, key differentiators, SHAP differences

### 8. Correlation Analysis (`/correlation` & built into `/analyze`)
- **What it provides**: Bivariate correlations with SHAP context
- **Business value**: "How does Nike relate to income across geographic areas?"
- **Data**: Correlation coefficients, relationship strength, geographic patterns
