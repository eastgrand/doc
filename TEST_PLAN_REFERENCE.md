   - Install any required dependencies as specified in the project documentation.

2. **Test Data Preparation**
   - Use only real data and URLs for testing.
   - Avoid using test, dummy, or mock data to ensure accurate and reliable test results.
   - Prepare test data sets for each component to be tested.
   - Ensure data sets cover various scenarios and edge cases.

3. **Test Environment Configuration**
   - Configure the test environment to match the production environment as closely as possible.
   - Set up any necessary network configurations or external service connections.

## Execution Steps
