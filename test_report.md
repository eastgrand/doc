## Test Infrastructure

The test suite includes:

1. **Individual Component Tests**
   - `test-layer-management-system.js`
   - `test-visualization-system.js`
   - `test-shap-microservice-integration.js`
   - `test-geospatial-chat-interface.js`

2. **Comprehensive Test Runner**
   - `run-all-tests.sh` - Runs all tests and generates a report

3. **Specialized Tests**
