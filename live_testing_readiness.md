## Live Testing Procedure
1. Deploy to staging environment first
2. Perform smoke tests on critical workflows
3. Monitor performance and error rates
4. Invite select users for beta testing
5. Address any issues found during beta testing
6. Deploy to production environment
7. Monitor closely for first 24 hours
8. Gather user feedback and make necessary adjustments

## Go/No-Go Decision
