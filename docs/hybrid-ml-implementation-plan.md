# Hybrid Query Processing Implementation Plan

## 1. Classification Layer âœ…
- Use existing pattern-matching system for initial query classification (visualization type)
- Add query complexity scoring (0-10) based on:
  - Number of parameters/variables requested
  - Presence of statistical terminology
  - Temporal requirements
  - Spatial relationship complexity

## 2. Routing Logic âœ…
- **Fast Path**: Simple queries (score â‰¤4) â†’ Rule-based processing only
- **Enhanced Path**: Complex queries (score >4) â†’ XGBoost/SHAP microservice
- **Override Rules**: Always use ML for specific cases:
  - Predictive queries ("where will crime increase next month?")
  - Multi-variable correlation analysis
  - Anomaly detection requests
  - Time-series forecasting

## 3. Technical Architecture âœ…
- Create microservice container with XGBoost/SHAP models
- Implement async processing queue for ML tasks
- Add results caching layer to improve performance for similar queries
- Include performance telemetry to adjust routing thresholds over time

## 4. Implementation Progress
1. âœ… Build complexity scoring function - **COMPLETE**
   - Created query-complexity-scorer.ts with scoring logic
   - Added multiple criteria evaluation (parameters, stats terms, temporal, spatial)
   - Implemented test suite in query-complexity-scorer.test.ts

2. âœ… Develop ML microservice with initial models - **COMPLETE**
   - Created Python Flask application (ml-service/app.py)
   - Implemented XGBoost models with SHAP explainability
   - Added Docker configuration for containerization
   - Created API endpoints for predictions

3. âœ… Implement routing logic with feature flags - **COMPLETE**
   - Developed HybridQueryProcessor class
   - Added feature flags for ML enable/disable and telemetry
   - Implemented fallback mechanism if ML service fails
   - Created React context for frontend integration

4. âœ… Add telemetry and caching - **COMPLETE**
   - Implemented telemetry collection in HybridQueryProcessor
   - Added caching in MLServiceClient with TTL
   - Created mechanism to limit cache size

5. âœ… Tune thresholds based on performance data - **COMPLETE**
   - Implemented adaptive threshold adjustment
   - Added time-based analysis to optimize ML usage

## Next Steps
1. ðŸ”œ Integration with existing workflow
   - Update existing query handling to use hybrid processor
   - Add ML indicator to UI

2. ðŸ”œ Performance monitoring
   - Add dashboard for tracking ML usage and performance
   - Implement A/B testing framework for threshold tuning

3. ðŸ”œ Model improvement process
   - Set up automated retraining pipeline
   - Implement feedback loop for model improvement

This approach gives you the best of both worlds - fast responses for simple queries and deeper analytical capabilities when needed.
