# Sample Areas Redesign Plan

## Executive Summary
Redesign the sample areas feature to be more project-relevant, visually informative, and user-friendly. Replace simple point markers with choropleth visualizations and provide immediate value through quick stats and easy dismissal options.

## Current State Analysis

### What Works Well
- City links for quick navigation
- Multiple sample locations (Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville)
- Categorized by type (retail, demographic, economic, transportation)
- Animated markers draw attention
- Auto-dismiss after 10 seconds

### Issues to Address
1. **Lack of Visual Context**: Current points don't show area boundaries or data
2. **No Project Relevance**: Fixed Florida locations may not match user's project area
3. **Limited Information**: No immediate stats or insights visible
4. **Dismissal Difficulty**: No clear way to immediately remove samples if not interested
5. **UI Issues**: Legend lacks white background, poor contrast in some themes
6. **Persistence**: Samples remain on map even when not relevant

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Dynamic Project-Relevant Areas
- **Auto-detect project region** from user's current view or project settings
- **Generate relevant sample areas** based on:
  - User's industry/project type (if known)
  - Current map extent
  - Available data layers
  - Recent search history

### 2. Choropleth Visualization
Replace point markers with:
- **Boundary polygons** showing actual area extent
- **Choropleth shading** displaying relevant metric (population density, income, etc.)
- **Dynamic coloring** based on data values
- **Semi-transparent fills** to see base map underneath

### 3. Sample Areas Component Redesign

```typescript
interface SampleArea {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  geometry: Polygon; // Changed from point to polygon
  bounds: Extent;
  primaryMetric: {
    name: string;
    value: number;
    unit: string;
    percentile?: number; // Compared to region
  };
  quickStats: {
    population: number;
    medianIncome: number;
    businesses: number;
    growth: number; // YoY percentage
  };
  choroplethData: {
    field: string;
    values: number[];
    colorScheme: string;
  };
  relevanceScore: number; // 0-100 based on project match
}
```

### 4. UI Component Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Sample Analysis Areas      [X]     │  <- White background panel
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  📍 Downtown Miami                  │
│  Population: 92,235 | Income: $67K  │
│  [View Details] [Zoom To]           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  📍 Tampa Bay Area                  │
│  Population: 384,959 | Growth: +3.2%│
│  [View Details] [Zoom To]           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [Clear All Samples]                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 5. Interaction Flow

#### On Load
1. Detect user's viewport/project area
2. Query for 3-4 relevant sample areas
3. Load choropleth data for primary metric
4. Display panel with white background
5. Render choropleth layers on map

#### On Area Selection
1. Zoom to area bounds (not just center point)
2. Update choropleth visualization
3. Display detailed stats panel
4. Highlight selected area in list

#### On Dismissal
1. **Close button (X)**: Removes all sample layers and hides panel
2. **Clear All Samples**: Removes layers but keeps panel
3. **Individual area removal**: Remove specific area's layers

### 6. Implementation Components

#### A. SampleAreasPanel Component
```typescript
// Main container with white background
- Fixed position (top-right or left sidebar)
- Collapsible/expandable
- Drag handle for repositioning
- Clear "X" close button
```

#### B. SampleAreaCard Component
```typescript
// Individual area display
- Area name and type icon
- 2-3 quick stats inline
- Action buttons (View/Zoom/Remove)
- Relevance indicator
```

#### C. ChoroplethLayer Service
```typescript
// Handles map visualization
- Creates feature layers from area data
- Applies graduated color renderer
- Manages layer visibility
- Handles selection highlighting
```

#### D. SampleAreaService
```typescript
// Business logic
- Determines relevant areas based on context
- Fetches area boundaries and stats
- Calculates relevance scores
- Caches frequently used areas
```

### 7. Data Requirements

## Questions for Stakeholder Review

1. What project types/industries should we prioritize for relevance?
2. Which statistics are most valuable for quick display?
3. Should sample areas persist across sessions?
4. What's the preferred panel position (top-right, left sidebar)?
5. Should we support custom sample area creation?
