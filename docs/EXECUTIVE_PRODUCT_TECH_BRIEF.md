# MPIQ AI Chat Platform – Executive & Technical Brief

Purpose: Single source overview for incoming CTO, investors, and sales/marketing. Mixes clear business value with concise technical depth.

---

## 1. Elevator Pitch

MPIQ AI Chat converts plain‑language business questions about markets, customers, competition, and locations into statistically grounded geospatial insights, interactive maps, and strategic narratives in seconds. It blends pre‑optimized multi-endpoint analysis, explainable AI (SHAP), and intelligent visualization to accelerate data-driven decisions without requiring GIS or data science expertise.

---

## 2. Core Customer Problems Solved

- Fragmented analytic workflows (GIS tools + BI dashboards + ad‑hoc data science)
- Slow turnaround for strategic “what/why/where” market questions
- Difficulty translating advanced statistical output into executive narratives
- Limited accessibility to geospatial & competitive intelligence across teams
- High cost of repeated model runs and large remote data pulls

---

## 3. What the Platform Does (Plain Language)

1. Understands a typed question (e.g., “Where is Nike underperforming versus Adidas with growth upside?”)
2. Classifies intent & selects the best of 16 analysis endpoints
3. Loads optimized, cached analytic datasets (no slow live feature pulls)
4. Runs specialized processors to compute metrics, rankings, differences, clusters, trends, anomalies, or projections
5. Generates an appropriate map layer + legend + statistical summary
6. Produces an explainable narrative (persona‑tailored) linking numbers to strategy
7. Enables export, follow‑up questions, and deeper comparative queries

---

## 4. Key Capabilities Snapshot

- 16 Dedicated Analysis Endpoints (competitive, demographic, clustering, risk, predictive, temporal, scenario, market sizing, profiling, outlier, etc.)
- 5 AI Personas (Strategist, Tactician, Creative, Product Specialist, Customer Advocate)
- Brand share & difference analysis (e.g., Nike vs Adidas) with market dominance profiling
- Multi‑endpoint routing & fallback (intelligent selection vs forced manual)
- Explainable AI via SHAP feature importance & factor narratives
- Dynamic choropleth / cluster / multi-symbol / difference / bivariate visualizations
- Endpoint‑aware statistical summaries (quintiles, variance, distribution, outliers)

## 8. Product Modules (Functional View)

- Query Understanding: Intent classification, concept mapping, endpoint suggestion
- Analysis Engine: Unified orchestration; routing → processing → visualization
- Data Processors: Endpoint-specific standardization & enrichment
- Visualization Renderer: Chooses and builds map layers (choropleth, cluster, difference, competitive symbols)
- State & Configuration Managers: Centralized, singleton configuration + lifecycle
- SHAP Microservice: Python/XGBoost inference + feature importance export
- Narrative Generator: Claude-driven persona narratives tied to metrics
- Performance & Caching Layer: Blob dataset access + intelligent reuse

---

## 9. Technical Architecture (Concise)

Core Stack:

- Frontend: Next.js (React), ArcGIS JS API for map rendering
- Services: TypeScript API routes + Python SHAP/XGBoost microservice
- Data Stores: Vercel Blob / S3 (optimized datasets), Redis (cache), PostgreSQL (configuration)
- AI: Anthropic Claude (classification + narrative), SHAP for explainability

High-Level Flow:

User Query → Classification & Concept Mapping → Endpoint Routing → Data Load (Blob) → Specialized Processing → Visualization Rendering → SHAP/Narrative → Response Output

Key Architectural Patterns:

- Single AnalysisEngine vs legacy multi-manager sprawl
- Specialized data processors registered per endpoint (16+) for clean separation
- Configuration-driven extensibility (no code edits for many additions)
- Lazy loading & caching to minimize network + memory overhead

Performance (documented figures):

- Page Load: <1s optimized
- Complex Analysis Response: <2s typical
- Data Footprint: ~249MB optimized blobs (vs 1.5GB original) via compression & pruning

---

## 10. Data & AI Layer

- Optimized Feature Blobs: Pre-filtered, deduplicated, compressed geospatial + metric datasets
- SHAP Integration: Precalculated/fast-on-demand feature importance aids narrative & scoring
- Brand Share Schemas: Normalized MP300-series fields enabling cross-brand difference & dominance analysis
- Statistical Methods: Quintile classification, variance, standard deviation, category dominance, outlier detection patterns
- Hybrid ML Routing: Lightweight heuristic + complexity scoring decides when advanced ML is invoked

---

## 11. Security, Reliability & Governance (Overview)

- Role-based potential extension (architecture accounts for multi-tenant config)
- Configuration versioning & rollback (ProjectConfigManager)
- Data validation checks: field existence, structure, success flags
- Error logging & structured recovery pathways (graceful fallback for missing endpoints)
- Encrypted transport (standard TLS assumptions; doc references to cert usage)

---

## 12. Extensibility & Roadmap Hooks

Current Extensibility Points:

- Add New Endpoint: Register processor + config entry
- Add Visualization Type: Extend renderer strategy map
- Add Persona: Insert prompt template; no engine refactor
- Add Data Source: Ingest & optimize to blob format; update config

Sample Forward Roadmap (Illustrative):
