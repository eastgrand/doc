    competitor_fields = engine.get_competitor_fields()  # Other developers/builders
    
    # Calculate total competitor market share
    total_competitor_share = 0
    for field in competitor_fields:
        competitor_value = engine.extract_field_value(record, field)
        total_competitor_share += competitor_value
    
    # Market dominance calculation
    if total_competitor_share > 0:

### Usage Guidelines and Best Practices for Real Estate Analysis

#### Real Estate Query Formulation Tips
1. **Specify Property Type**: Include "residential", "commercial", "multi-family" when relevant
2. **Use Investment Language**: "investment", "opportunity", "returns", "risk", "performance"
3. **Include Geographic Scope**: "by market", "across regions", "metro areas", "neighborhoods"
4. **Reference Market Metrics**: "property values", "affordability", "demand", "supply"

#### Real Estate Query Patterns
```
Investment: "Show me the best real estate investment opportunities in [region]"
Market Analysis: "Analyze housing market performance in [metro area]"
Risk Assessment: "What are the risks for real estate investment in [market]?"
Demographic: "What demographics drive housing demand in [area]?"
Comparative: "Compare real estate markets between [city A] and [city B]"
```

#### Expected Real Estate Response Elements
- **Investment Scores**: ROI potential, risk-adjusted returns, market opportunity ratings
- **Market Intelligence**: Supply/demand dynamics, price trends, affordability metrics
- **Demographic Insights**: Buyer profiles, household formation, income characteristics
- **Risk Analysis**: Market volatility, economic sensitivity, regulatory factors
- **Visual Analytics**: Property value heatmaps, market trend charts, demographic overlays

#### Real Estate Investment Context
- **Primary Use Case**: Investment decision support for individual and institutional investors
- **Geographic Focus**: Market-by-market analysis for targeted investment strategies
- **Demographic Integration**: Homebuyer and renter demographic analysis
- **Economic Factors**: Interest rates, employment, income growth impacts on housing
- **Property Types**: Residential, commercial, mixed-use development opportunities

## Data Pipeline and Microservice Integration

### Complete Data Flow Architecture

1. **Target Variable Definition**:
   - Property Value Analysis: Target variable represents housing market performance metrics
   - Market-specific configurations based on analysis requirements
   - Target represents performance values in each geographic area

2. **Microservice Data Extraction** (`enhanced_analysis_worker.py`):
   ```python
   # Extract target value from microservice data
   target_val = safe_float(row[target_variable])
   result['target_value'] = target_val  # Used by all processors
   result[clean_field_name] = target_val  # Market-specific field
   ```

3. **SHAP Value Generation**:
   - **Endpoint**: `/factor-importance` with `method: "shap"`
   - **Purpose**: Generates explainable AI feature importance for target variable
   - **Format**: SHAP values stored as `shap_{field_name}` for demographic factors
   - **Usage**: Multiple processors use SHAP values for housing market analysis

4. **Field Extraction Pattern**:
   ```python
   # Demographic fields: Population, age distribution, household composition
   # Housing fields: Property values, ownership rates, rental metrics
   # SHAP fields: shap_{field_name} for explainable AI feature importance
   # Economic fields: Income levels, economic stability indicators
   ```

5. **Automation Pipeline** (`automated_score_calculator.py`):
   - Processes microservice data through multiple scoring algorithms
   - Integrates SHAP values for explainable scoring
   - Generates processor-specific scores using actual formulas
   - Outputs comprehensive analysis data for real estate visualization

### Microservice Role and Purpose

The **SHAP Demographic Analytics Microservice** serves as the core data intelligence engine for real estate analysis:

- **Data Source**: Comprehensive demographic, economic, and housing fields per geographic area
- **AI Processing**: Machine learning models with SHAP explainability for housing markets
- **Target Analysis**: Configurable target variables for real estate metrics
- **Outputs**: Raw housing data + SHAP feature importance + correlation analysis
- **Integration**: Feeds processed data to real estate analysis processors

The microservice is essential because it provides both the raw housing market data AND the explainable AI insights that make real estate processor scoring scientifically rigorous rather than just heuristic property value calculations.
