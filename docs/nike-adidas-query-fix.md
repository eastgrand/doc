# Nike vs Adidas Query – Fix Summary

This document records the code changes and configuration updates that resolved the long-standing issue where the query:

```
Compare Nike vs Adidas athletic shoe purchases across regions
```

returned *"data not available"* and showed technical field codes in the analysis.  After these fixes the query now returns a correct, brand-specific comparison with no exposed field codes.

---

## 1. Removed Obsolete `conversion_rate` Fallback

**Files updated**
- `components/geospatial-chat-interface.tsx`
- `lib/concept-mapping.ts`
- `services/local-config-manager.ts`

**Key points**
1. Replaced the hard-coded fallback `conversion_rate` with a neutral placeholder `thematic_value`.
2. Removed all hard-coded references to `conversion_rate` in data extraction and property mapping.
3. Ensured no phantom field is injected into microservice requests.

## 2. Hid Technical Field Codes from Claude

**File updated**: `app/api/claude/generate-response/route.ts`

The data summary previously appended codes like `(mp30034a_b)` after human-readable names, which Claude then echoed.  We:
- Removed the `${fieldCode}` parenthetical from **Primary Analysis Field** lines.
- Removed codes from **Available Data Fields** listings.

Result: user-facing analysis now shows only friendly field names.

## 3. Robust Brand Detection in Concept Mapping

**File updated**: `lib/concept-mapping.ts`

Added a *direct brand mapping* layer that bypasses keyword scoring.  It maps brand tokens in the query straight to their dataset codes and ensures the correct layer is requested.

```ts
const brandFieldMap = {
  nike:   'MP30034A_B',
  adidas: 'MP30029A_B',
  jordan: 'MP30032A_B',
  converse: 'MP30031A_B',
};
```

When a brand name is found it now:
1. Adds the field to `matchedFields` with a high score.
2. Forces inclusion of the `athleticShoePurchases` layer.

---

## 4. TypeScript Build Fixes

Using spread syntax on `Set` caused TS2802 errors.  Replaced instances with `Array.from(new Set(...))`.

---

## 5. Graceful Error Handling in Claude Route

Unexpected missing data previously triggered uncaught exceptions → 500 responses.  Added guard clauses that:
- Emit clear console errors.
- Return JSON `400` with descriptive messages instead of crashing.

---

## 6. Miscellaneous

* Commented out noisy debug logs once validation succeeded.
* Verified external Anthropic 529 *Overloaded* response was unrelated to code; query works when service load normalises.

---

### Outcome
- Nike and Adidas fields (`MP30034A_B`, `MP30029A_B`) are now passed end-to-end.
- Claude receives complete, clean summaries and returns a correct comparative analysis.
- The fix generalises to **any** brand pair (Jordan vs Converse, etc.) without further changes.
