## 🚀 **Implementation Pattern**

### **Consistent Structure Across All Processors:**
```typescript
// 1. Calculate baseline metrics first
const avgScore = records.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.value, 0) / records.length;
const metricBaselines = calculateSpecificMetrics(records);

// 2. Add prominent baseline section
summary += `**📊 [Analysis Type] Baseline & Market Averages:** `;
summary += `Market average [metric]: ${avgScore.toFixed(1)} (range: ${min}-${max}). `;
summary += `Baseline context: [specific metrics]. `;

// 3. Include distribution analysis
summary += `Distribution: [performance tiers with percentages].\n\n`;
```

### **Key Principles:**
1. **Prominence**: Baseline section appears early in analysis
2. **Consistency**: Similar format across all analysis types
3. **Context**: Range and distribution provide perspective
4. **Actionability**: Metrics directly support business decisions
