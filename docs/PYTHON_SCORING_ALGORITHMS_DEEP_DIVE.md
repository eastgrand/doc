    if key.startswith('shap_') and isinstance(value, (int, float)):
        shap_sum += abs(float(value))
        shap_count += 1

feature_importance_score = min((shap_sum / shap_count) * 10, 100)
```

**Strengths:**

**Score**: 7/10 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Formula:**
```python
strategic_value_score = (
    0.35 * market_opportunity +      # Demographics + market gap
    0.30 * competitive_position +    # Competition + brand position
    0.20 * data_reliability +        # Correlation + cluster quality
    0.15 * market_scale              # Population + economic scale
)
```

**Component Breakdown:**
```python
# Market Opportunity (35%)
market_opportunity = (0.60 * demographic_score) + (0.40 * market_gap)

# Competitive Position (30%)
competitive_position = (0.67 * competitive_score) + (0.33 * brand_positioning)

# Data Reliability (20%)
data_reliability = (0.75 * correlation_score) + (0.25 * cluster_consistency)

# Market Scale (15%)

```

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive multi-factor analysis

#### 4. ComparativeAnalysisProcessor - `calculate_comparative_scores()`
**Location**: Lines 384-413
**Score**: 7/10 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Formula:**
```python
# Standard percentile ranking
values = [target_value for record in records if target_value > 0]
values_sorted = sorted(values)

for each record:
    if target_value > 0:
        percentile = (count of values <= target_value) / total_count * 100
    else:
        percentile = 0
        
comparative_score = percentile
```

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Mathematically correct percentile calculation

#### 5. SpatialClustersProcessor - `calculate_cluster_scores()`
**Location**: Lines 415-469
**Score**: 6/10 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Formula:**
```python
# Simple 5-cluster percentile-based grouping
n_clusters = 5
percentiles = [20, 40, 60, 80]  # Calculated from valid data

# Cluster assignment with fixed scores
if target_value <= percentiles[0]: cluster_score = 20      # Low
elif target_value <= percentiles[1]: cluster_score = 40    # Below Average  
elif target_value <= percentiles[2]: cluster_score = 60    # Average
elif target_value <= percentiles[3]: cluster_score = 80    # Above Average
else: cluster_score = 100                                  # High Performance
```

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Clear performance tiers
- ‚úÖ Data-driven percentile boundaries
- ‚úÖ Intuitive cluster labels

**Weaknesses:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Fixed cluster count (5) may not be optimal
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Linear score assignment (20, 40, 60, 80, 100)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No geographic spatial analysis (just value-based clustering)

**Project Applicability:**
- **Universal**: Performance clustering works for any domain
- **Enhancement opportunity**: Could add true spatial analysis

**Business Accuracy**: **Moderate** - effective but simplistic

---

#### 6. PredictiveModelingProcessor - `calculate_predictive_scores()`
**Location**: Lines 498-532
**Score**: 6/10 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Formula:**
```python

    predictive_score = (
        0.40 * demographic_opportunity_score +
        0.35 * competitive_advantage_score +
        0.25 * min(target_value, 100)
    )
else:
    predictive_score = min(target_value, 100)
```

**Strengths:**

**Business Accuracy**: **Moderate** - solid composite but not truly predictive

---

### Tier 3: Needs Improvement ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### 7. DemographicDataProcessor - `calculate_demographic_scores()`
**Location**: Lines 312-382
**Score**: 4/10 ‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Formula:**
```python
# Diversity calculation with hardcoded preferences
if total_population > 0:
    diversity_score = (
        (asian_population / total_population) * 30 +        # Asian bias
        (black_population / total_population) * 20 +        # Black factor
        min(median_income / 75000, 1) * 25 +               # Income target: $75K
        max(0, 1 - abs(median_age - 35) / 20) * 15 +       # Optimal age: 35
        min(household_size / 3, 1) * 10                     # Target HH size: 3
    ) * 100
else:
    diversity_score = 0

population_bonus = min(total_population / 10000, 1) * 20
demographic_opportunity_score = min(diversity_score + population_bonus, 100)
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå **Retail-biased demographic assumptions**
- ‚ùå Hardcoded "optimal" age of 35 years
- ‚ùå Assumes Asian population = 30% importance weight
- ‚ùå Arbitrary income target ($75K)
- ‚ùå Fixed household size preference (3 people)

**Project Applicability:**
- **Retail**: Potentially biased but might work
- **Real Estate**: **Unsuitable** - homebuyer demographics are different
- **Critical Need**: Project-specific demographic weighting

**Business Accuracy**: **Poor** - too many hardcoded assumptions

---

#### 8. TrendAnalysisProcessor - `calculate_trend_scores()`
**Location**: Lines 575-594
**Score**: 2/10 ‚≠ê

**Formula:**
```python
# Overly simplistic baseline comparison
baseline = 50  # Hardcoded baseline
trend_strength_score = max(0, min((target_value / baseline) * 50, 100))
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå **Arbitrary baseline of 50**
- ‚ùå No actual time-series analysis
- ‚ùå No trend direction detection
- ‚ùå Scaling factor (√ó50) has no justification

**Project Applicability:**
- **Universal**: Simple but ineffective across all domains

**Business Accuracy**: **Very Poor** - doesn't measure trends

**Recommendation**: **Complete rewrite** with time-series analysis

---

#### 9. CorrelationAnalysisProcessor - `calculate_correlation_scores()`
**Location**: Lines 471-496
**Score**: 2/10 ‚≠ê

**Formula:**
```python
# Uses pre-existing correlation or weak fallback
if 'correlation_score' in record:
    correlation_strength_score = safe_float(record.correlation_score)
else:
    # Arbitrary fallback calculation
    if target_value > 0 and median_income > 0:
        correlation_strength_score = min((target_value * median_income / 1000000), 100)
    else:
        correlation_strength_score = 0
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå **Arbitrary fallback formula** `(target √ó income) / 1M`
- ‚ùå No statistical correlation calculation
- ‚ùå Depends on pre-calculated correlation_score existing

**Project Applicability:**
- **Universal**: Correlation concept works everywhere
- **Implementation**: Fundamentally flawed

**Business Accuracy**: **Very Poor** - fallback formula is meaningless

**Recommendation**: **Implement proper correlation analysis**

---

### Tier 4: Critical Issues ‚ùå

#### 10. ScenarioAnalysisProcessor - `calculate_scenario_scores()`
**Location**: Lines 648-669
**Score**: 1/10 

**Formula:**
```python
# Simplistic scenario weighting
base_score = min(target_value, 100)
scenario_analysis_score = (
    0.25 * (base_score * 1.2) +  # "Optimistic" = 20% boost
    0.50 * base_score +          # "Realistic" = current value
    0.25 * (base_score * 0.8)    # "Pessimistic" = 20% reduction
)
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå **Arbitrary percentage adjustments** (¬±20%)
- ‚ùå No actual scenario modeling
- ‚ùå No external factors consideration
- ‚ùå Meaningless "scenario" analysis

**Business Accuracy**: **Terrible** - not real scenario analysis

**Recommendation**: **Complete replacement** with proper scenario modeling

### Real-World Usage Examples

**Adding New Project Type (Education)**:
```json
// project_types/education.json
{
  "business_logic": {
    "demographic_income_target": 60000,
    "demographic_age_target": 25,
    "competitive_analysis_weight": 0.20
  },
  "semantic_field_priorities": {
    "consumer_income": ["parent_household_income", "median_family_income"],
    "market_size": ["student_population", "school_age_population"],
    "target_performance": ["test_scores", "graduation_rates", "college_readiness"]
  }
}
```

**Universal Code Usage**:
```python
# Same engine, different configurations
engine_retail = ConfigurableAlgorithmEngine("projects/retail_2025")
engine_education = ConfigurableAlgorithmEngine("projects/education_2025")
engine_healthcare = ConfigurableAlgorithmEngine("projects/healthcare_2025")

# All use identical algorithm implementations with different business logic
retail_scores = engine_retail.calculate_all_scores(retail_data)
education_scores = engine_education.calculate_all_scores(education_data)
healthcare_scores = engine_healthcare.calculate_all_scores(healthcare_data)
```
