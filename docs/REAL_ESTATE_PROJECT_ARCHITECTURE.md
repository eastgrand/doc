# Real Estate Brokerage Analytics Platform Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architectural approach for transforming the MPIQ AI Chat Platform into a real estate-focused analytics system for brokers serving residential property buyers and sellers. The system will leverage point-based data for individual properties while maintaining FSA polygon capabilities for area selection and aggregation.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### 1. Data Model: Point-Based with Polygon Support

**Decision**: Use individual property points as the primary data model with FSA polygon aggregation as secondary.

**Rationale**:
- **Accuracy**: Individual property data provides precise analysis for specific listings, comparables, and market trends
- **Flexibility**: Supports custom boundaries (drive-time polygons, hand-drawn areas) without pre-aggregation limitations
- **Granularity**: Enables property-level predictions and correlations
- **Scalability**: Can aggregate to FSAs when needed while maintaining detail

**Implementation**:
- Each record represents a single property with coordinates
- Properties indexed spatially for efficient querying
- FSA polygons used for area selection UI and optional aggregation
- Support for dynamic polygon creation (drive-time, custom boundaries)

### 2. Multi-Target Scoring System

**Decision**: Implement separate models for each target variable with unified scoring interface.

**Rationale**:
- Each target variable (sold price, rent price, time on market) has distinct features and patterns
- Separate models allow optimization for each specific prediction task
- Unified interface maintains consistency for end users

**Target Variables**:
1. **Sold Price Prediction** - Historical sales analysis and future price modeling
2. **Time on Market Prediction** - Days to sale forecasting
3. **Price Volatility Score** - Market stability assessment
4. **Neighborhood Desirability Score** - Quality of life and amenity access
5. **Buyer Competition Index** - Multiple offer likelihood and bidding pressure

### 3. Temporal Data Architecture

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive time-series processing with multiple aggregation levels.

**Data Preparation Strategy**:
```typescript
interface TemporalDataPoint {
  propertyId: string;
  coordinates: [number, number];
  dateListed: Date;        // ISO format: 2025-04-17
  dateSold?: Date;
  daysOnMarket?: number;
  
  // Derived temporal features
  listingMonth: number;     // 1-12
  listingQuarter: number;   // 1-4
  listingYear: number;
  listingWeek: number;      // 1-52
  seasonality: 'spring' | 'summer' | 'fall' | 'winter';
  
  // Market context
  monthlyInventory: number;
  yearOverYearChange: number;
  movingAveragePrice30: number;
  movingAveragePrice90: number;
}
```

**Aggregation Levels**:
- **Weekly**: 7-day rolling windows for immediate trends
- **Monthly**: Calendar month aggregations for seasonal patterns
- **Quarterly**: Business quarter analysis
- **Annual**: Year-over-year comparisons
- **Custom**: User-defined date ranges

### 4. Processor Architecture Evolution

#### Reusable Existing Processors

These processors work with point data with minimal modification:

1. **BaseProcessor** - Already supports flexible field extraction
2. **OutlierDetectionProcessor** - Identifies unusual properties/pricing
3. **TrendAnalysisProcessor** - Temporal trend analysis
4. **CorrelationAnalysisProcessor** - Feature relationships
5. **ClusterDataProcessor** - Geographic clustering of properties
6. **ComparativeAnalysisProcessor** - Property comparisons
7. **PredictiveModelingProcessor** - Price predictions

#### New Real Estate-Specific Processors

```typescript
// 1. Market Heat Map Processor
export class MarketHeatProcessor extends BaseProcessor {
  // Analyzes transaction velocity, price changes, inventory levels
  // Produces "hot market" scores for geographic areas
}

// 2. First-Time Buyer Opportunity Processor
export class FirstTimeBuyerProcessor extends BaseProcessor {
  // Identifies affordable entry-level properties
  // Considers down payment requirements, neighborhood amenities
}

// 3. Housing Affordability Index Processor
export class AffordabilityProcessor extends BaseProcessor {
  // Calculates affordability based on median income vs. housing costs
  // Includes mortgage rates, property taxes, insurance
}

// 4. Comparable Sales Processor

  // Finds and ranks comparable properties
  // Adjusts for differences in features, location, time
}

// 5. Home Value Trajectory Processor
export class HomeValueTrajectoryProcessor extends BaseProcessor {
  // Predicts future home values for owner-occupants
  // Considers neighborhood development, school improvements
}

// 6. Market Timing Processor

  // Optimal listing time analysis
  // Seasonal patterns and market cycle positioning
}

// 7. Neighborhood Trajectory Processor  
export class NeighborhoodTrajectoryProcessor extends BaseProcessor {
  // Gentrification indicators, development patterns
  // Future value predictions based on area trends
}

3. **Aggregation Caching**: Pre-compute common aggregations
4. **Progressive Loading**: Stream results as they process
5. **WebGL Rendering**: For large point datasets

#### Data Pipeline

```typescript
class RealEstateDataPipeline {
  // Extract from MLS, public records, APIs
  async extractPropertyData(source: DataSource): Promise<RawProperty[]>
  
  // Geocode, standardize, validate
  async processPropertyData(properties: RawProperty[]): Promise<ProcessedProperty[]>
  
  // Calculate derived metrics
  async enrichPropertyData(properties: ProcessedProperty[]): Promise<EnrichedProperty[]>
  
  // Create spatial indexes
  async indexProperties(properties: EnrichedProperty[]): Promise<SpatialIndex>
  
  // Generate time-series aggregations
  async createTemporalAggregations(properties: EnrichedProperty[]): Promise<TimeSeriesData>
}
```

### 11. API Endpoints Structure

```typescript
// Real Estate Specific Endpoints
interface RealEstateEndpoints {
