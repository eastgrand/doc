## 🎯 Purpose

This section contains documentation that is:
- **Under Development**: Not yet finalized or approved
- **In Planning Phase**: Proposals awaiting decision or implementation
- **Research Stage**: Exploratory work and analysis
- **Draft Status**: Incomplete but actively being worked on

## 📋 Document Lifecycle

### **Draft → Planning → Implementation → Current**

1. **drafts/**: Initial document creation and development
2. **planning/**: Finalized plans awaiting implementation
3. **research/**: Analysis and exploration of approaches
4. **→ /implementation/**: Move when implementation begins
5. **→ /current/**: Move when implementation is complete

## 🔄 Status Indicators

### 📝 **Draft Documents**
