# Dynamic Brand Naming Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to implement dynamic brand naming across analysis processors, replacing generic "Brand A", "Brand B" terminology with actual brand names sourced from field-aliases configuration.

## Current State

### Analysis Prompts ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- All analysis prompts have been made generic and brand-agnostic
- No hardcoded Nike/Adidas references in prompt templates
- Prompts use generic terminology like "brand performance", "competitive positioning"

### Processors üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- `ComparativeAnalysisProcessor` currently uses generic "Brand A/B" in output
- Other brand-related processors likely have similar generic or hardcoded references
- Field detection is dynamic but naming is still generic

## Goal

Transform processor outputs from:
```
‚Ä¢ Brand Performance Gap (35% weight): Brand A vs competitors performance differential
‚Ä¢ Market dominance: 15 Brand A-dominant markets (18.3%), 42 balanced markets (51.2%)
```

To:
```
‚Ä¢ Brand Performance Gap (35% weight): Nike vs competitors performance differential  
‚Ä¢ Market dominance: 15 Nike-dominant markets (18.3%), 42 balanced markets (51.2%)
```

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Field-Aliases Integration Utility

Create a shared utility class for brand name resolution:

```typescript
class BrandNameResolver {
  constructor(fieldAliases?: Record<string, string>) {
    this.fieldAliases = fieldAliases || {};
  }

  /**
   * Extract brand name from field alias
   * Example: "Nike Market Share (%)" ‚Üí "Nike"
   */
  extractBrandName(fieldName: string): string | null {
    const alias = this.fieldAliases[fieldName];
    if (!alias) return null;
    
    // Parse brand name from aliases like:
    // "Nike Market Share (%)" ‚Üí "Nike"
    // "Adidas Purchase Intent" ‚Üí "Adidas" 
    // "Jordan Brand Affinity" ‚Üí "Jordan"
    
    return this.parseBrandFromAlias(alias);
  }

  /**
   * Get branded terminology for analysis output
   */
  getBrandedTerm(genericTerm: string, brandName: string): string {
    return genericTerm.replace(/Brand A|Brand B/g, brandName);
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Processor Integration

Update processors to use actual brand names:

#### 2.1 ComparativeAnalysisProcessor (FIRST)
- Integrate `BrandNameResolver` 
- Update `extractBrandMetric()` to return both value and brand name
- Modify summary generation to use actual brand names
- Fallback to "Brand A/B" when names unavailable

#### 2.2 Other Priority Processors
1. **BrandAnalysisProcessor** - Direct brand strength analysis
2. **BrandDifferenceProcessor** - Brand vs brand comparisons  
3. **CompetitiveDataProcessor** - Competitive landscape
4. **CorrelationAnalysisProcessor** - Brand correlation analysis
5. **CustomerProfileProcessor** - Brand affinity segments

## Implementation Details

### Field-Aliases Integration Points

#### Data Source
```typescript
interface ProcessorInput {
  rawData: RawAnalysisResult;
  fieldAliases?: Record<string, string>; // NEW: Pass field-aliases to processor
  // ... other existing fields
}
```

#### Brand Detection Enhancement
```typescript
private extractBrandMetric(record: any, brandType: 'brand_a' | 'brand_b'): BrandMetric {
  const brandFields = this.findBrandFields(record);
  const fieldName = brandFields[brandType === 'brand_a' ? 0 : 1];
  
  return {
    value: Number(record[fieldName]) || 0,
    fieldName: fieldName,
    brandName: this.brandNameResolver.extractBrandName(fieldName) || `Brand ${brandType === 'brand_a' ? 'A' : 'B'}`
  };
}
```

#### Summary Generation Update
```typescript
private generateComparativeSummary(records: GeographicDataPoint[], brandAName: string, brandBName: string): string {
  let summary = `**‚öñÔ∏è Comparative Analysis Formula (0-100 scale):**
‚Ä¢ **Brand Performance Gap (35% weight):** ${brandAName} vs competitors performance differential
‚Ä¢ **Market Position Strength (30% weight):** Relative market positioning and dominance
‚Ä¢ **Competitive Dynamics (25% weight):** Competitive pressure and market share dynamics
‚Ä¢ **Growth Differential (10% weight):** Relative growth potential and trend momentum

Higher scores indicate stronger competitive advantages and superior market positioning.
`;

  // ... rest of summary using brandAName/brandBName throughout
}
```

### Fallback Strategy

1. **Primary**: Use field-aliases to extract brand names
2. **Secondary**: Attempt to parse brand names from field names (mp30034a_b ‚Üí "Nike" via lookup table)
3. **Fallback**: Use generic "Brand A", "Brand B" terminology

### Brand Name Parsing Logic

Common field alias patterns to handle:
- "Nike Market Share (%)" ‚Üí "Nike"
- "Adidas Purchase Frequency" ‚Üí "Adidas"  
- "Jordan Brand Loyalty Score" ‚Üí "Jordan"
- "Brand Affinity - Nike" ‚Üí "Nike"
- "Market Share: Adidas" ‚Üí "Adidas"

Parsing rules:
1. Look for known brand names at start of alias
2. Look for brand names after common separators (-, :, |)
3. Use word boundary detection for brand extraction

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Clarity**: "Nike dominates with 67% market share" vs "Brand A dominates with 67% market share"
- **Actionability**: Users immediately understand which brands are being analyzed
- **Professional**: Analysis looks more polished and context-aware

### Technical Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Prompts remain generic and reusable
- **Flexibility**: Same processor works across different brand datasets
- **Consistency**: All processors use same brand naming approach

### Business Benefits
- **Faster Insights**: No mental translation from "Brand A" to actual brand
- **Better Reports**: Analysis can be shared directly with stakeholders
- **Scalability**: System works with any brand set without prompt changes
