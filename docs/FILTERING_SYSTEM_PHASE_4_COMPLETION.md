## 🏗️ **IMPLEMENTATION ARCHITECTURE**

### **Data Sampling System**
```typescript
3 Sampling Strategies:
├── Random Sampling
│   ├── Range: 100-50,000 records
│   ├── Best for: General analysis with uniform data distribution
│   └── Strategy: Randomly select records from entire dataset
├── Systematic Sampling  
│   ├── Range: 500-25,000 records
│   ├── Best for: Time-series or ordered data analysis
│   └── Strategy: Select every nth record for consistent coverage
└── Stratified Sampling
    ├── Range: 1,000-30,000 records
    ├── Best for: Maintaining representation across demographic groups
    └── Strategy: Proportional sampling across different categories
```

### **Caching Management System**
```typescript
5 TTL Presets:
├── 5 minutes: Real-time analysis, frequently updated datasets
├── 30 minutes: Interactive exploration, iterative analysis
├── 1 hour: Standard cache duration (recommended)
├── 4 hours: Production reports, scheduled analysis
└── 24 hours: Historical data, reference datasets
```

### **Timeout Control System**
```typescript
5 Timeout Presets:
├── 30 seconds: Quick queries on small datasets
├── 1 minute: Standard timeout for most queries  
├── 2 minutes: Extended timeout (recommended)
├── 5 minutes: Complex operations, larger datasets
└── 10 minutes: Maximum timeout for comprehensive analysis
```

### **Quality Control System**
```typescript
Quality Indicators:
├── Data Completeness (Green): Percentage of non-null values
├── Spatial Coverage (Blue): Geographic data coverage
├── Analysis Confidence (Purple): Statistical confidence levels
└── Result Validity (Orange): Data consistency and accuracy
```
