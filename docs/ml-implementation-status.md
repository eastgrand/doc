# ML Query Classification Implementation Status

## What's Been Implemented

1. **ML Architecture Setup**
   - Created a comprehensive implementation plan in `docs/ml-query-classification-plan.md`
   - Set up directory structure for ML training and model serving
   - Created sample data in `data/query-classification-samples.csv`
   - Implemented data generation script in `scripts/generate-training-data.js`

2. **Training Pipeline**
   - Implemented a training script (`scripts/train-model.py`) using TensorFlow and Transformers
   - Set up configuration for model parameters and training hyperparameters
   - Added conversion to TensorFlow.js format for web deployment

3. **Vercel Serverless Integration**
   - Created Vercel serverless function for query classification
   - Set up API endpoint with model loading and caching
   - Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

4. **Client-Side Integration**
   - Implemented client-side ML query classifier in `lib/ml-query-classifier.ts`
   - Added integration with existing pattern-matching system
   - Made ML inference work as an enhancement rather than replacement
   - Added caching mechanism to improve performance

5. **Type System Improvements**
   - Fixed TypeScript issues in `components/geospatial-chat-interface.tsx`
   - Made ML query classifier API synchronous for better integration
   - Added proper error handling for ML model failures

## What's Next

1. **Training the Model**
   - Gather and prepare more comprehensive training data
   - Train the model using the established pipeline
   - Evaluate model performance and tune hyperparameters

2. **Deployment and Testing**
   - Deploy the model to Vercel
   - Implement A/B testing to compare ML vs pattern matching accuracy
   - Monitor performance metrics and user feedback

3. **Enhancements**
   - Implement confidence threshold tuning based on performance
   - Add user feedback mechanism to improve model over time
   - Optimize model size and loading times for better performance

4. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive user documentation
   - Document model architecture and training process
   - Add developer guides for extending the system

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Run the data generation script to create training data:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   npm install
   node generate-training-data.js
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies and train the model:
   ```bash
   pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
   python scripts/train-model.py
   ```

3. Test the Vercel function locally before deployment:
   ```bash
   cd api/classify-query
   npm install
   node -e "require('./index').default({body: JSON.stringify({query: 'show me income levels by region'})}).then(console.log)"
   ```

4. Deploy to Vercel and update configuration to point to the deployed model.
