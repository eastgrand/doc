# AI Personas System

## Overview
The AI Personas system allows users to select different analytical perspectives when querying geospatial data. Each persona represents a distinct approach to data analysis, with specialized prompts and focus areas tailored to different business roles and decision-making contexts.

## Persona Definitions

### 1. Strategist
**Focus**: High-level market insights, competitive positioning, and long-term growth opportunities
- Emphasizes market trends, competitive landscapes, and strategic implications
- Provides executive-level summaries with actionable strategic recommendations
- Focuses on broader market patterns and business implications

### 2. Tactician  
**Focus**: Operational efficiency, resource allocation, and tactical implementation
- Emphasizes practical execution and operational optimization
- Provides specific, actionable recommendations for immediate implementation
- Focuses on resource deployment and tactical decision-making

### 3. Creative
**Focus**: Innovation opportunities, emerging trends, and creative solutions
- Emphasizes unique insights, creative interpretations, and innovative approaches
- Provides inspiration for new product ideas or marketing campaigns
- Focuses on unconventional patterns and creative opportunities

### 4. Product Specialist
**Focus**: Product development, feature optimization, and user experience insights
- Emphasizes product-market fit, feature performance, and user behavior patterns
- Provides recommendations for product development and optimization
- Focuses on user needs and product enhancement opportunities

### 5. Customer Advocate
**Focus**: Customer satisfaction, experience optimization, and service improvements
- Emphasizes customer needs, pain points, and satisfaction drivers
- Provides recommendations for improving customer experience
- Focuses on customer-centric insights and service optimization

## Technical Implementation

### Current State
- Single prompt system using `app/api/claude/generate-response/route.ts`
- Unified system prompt for all analysis types
- Basic analysis type detection (correlation, thematic, joint, etc.)

### Planned Architecture

#### 1. Persona Selection UI
- **Location**: Persona button in first button row of query UI
- **Component**: Dialog with 5 persona options
- **Display**: Persona name + Focus description
- **State Management**: Selected persona stored in component state

#### 2. Prompt System Architecture
```
app/api/claude/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generate-response/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ route.ts (main handler)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ strategist.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tactician.ts  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ creative.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ product-specialist.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ customer-advocate.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ base-prompt.ts (common elements)
```

#### 3. Prompt Structure
Each persona prompt file will export:
- `systemPrompt`: Core persona-specific instructions
- `taskInstructions`: Analysis approach guidelines
- `responseFormat`: Output formatting preferences
- `focusAreas`: Key analytical priorities

#### 4. Integration Points
- **Request Metadata**: Include selected persona in request payload
- **Route Handler**: Load appropriate prompt based on persona selection
- **Response Processing**: Apply persona-specific formatting and emphasis

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Prompt Development ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Create the core prompt system architecture and specialized persona prompts
- ‚úÖ Analyze existing `route.ts` prompts to understand current system
- ‚úÖ Create `app/api/claude/prompts/` directory structure
- ‚úÖ Develop specialized prompt files for each persona:
  - ‚úÖ `strategist.ts` - Market insights and competitive positioning
  - ‚úÖ `tactician.ts` - Operational efficiency and resource allocation  
  - ‚úÖ `creative.ts` - Innovation and emerging trends
  - ‚úÖ `product-specialist.ts` - Product development and UX insights
  - ‚úÖ `customer-advocate.ts` - Customer satisfaction and experience
- ‚úÖ Create `shared/base-prompt.ts` for common elements
- ‚úÖ Ensure prompts work with existing analysis types (correlation, thematic, joint, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Create `index.ts` with persona registry and metadata for UI integration

**Phase 1 Accomplishments:**
- Created complete prompt system architecture with 5 specialized personas
- Each persona has unique system prompts, task instructions, and response formatting
- Established shared base prompt elements for consistency across personas
- Built persona registry system for dynamic loading and UI integration
- Added metadata with icons and colors for UI display
- Ensured compatibility with existing analysis types (correlation, thematic, joint, etc.)
- Ready for API integration in Phase 2

#### Phase 2: API Integration ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Integrate persona system into the API route handler
- ‚úÖ Modify `route.ts` to accept persona parameter
- ‚úÖ Add prompt loading logic based on selected persona
- ‚úÖ Update system prompt construction to use persona-specific prompts
- ‚úÖ Maintain backward compatibility with existing requests
- ‚úÖ Test API functionality with different persona selections

**Phase 2 Accomplishments:**
- Successfully integrated persona system into the main API route handler
- Added persona parameter to RequestBody interface and request parsing
- Implemented dynamic persona loading with error handling and fallback
- Updated system prompt construction to use persona-specific prompts instead of hardcoded content
- Added analysis type-aware task instructions for each persona
- Maintained full backward compatibility - existing requests work without persona parameter
- Added comprehensive logging for persona selection and loading
- Ready for UI implementation in Phase 3

#### Phase 3: UI Implementation ‚è≥
**Goal**: Create the user interface for persona selection
- Implement persona selection dialog component
- Add persona state management to query UI
- Update request building to include selected persona
- Ensure proper integration with existing query flow
- Add visual indicators for selected persona

#### Phase 4: Testing & Validation ‚úÖ
**Goal achieved**: Persona-loader unit tests and API-level integration tests ensure:
- Each registered persona loads correctly with required fields.
- `generate-response` route forwards the proper persona prompt (with Anthropic client stub).
- Graceful fallback to the default persona on invalid ID.

#### Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment üöÄ  *(monitoring & feedback steps intentionally skipped)*
**Focus**: Ship the feature with clear guidance for users and developers.

1. **User-Facing Docs:**
   - Update the main product README and in-app help to explain persona selection and appropriate use cases.
   - Include a quick-start table mapping each persona ‚Üí best-fit business questions.

2. **Developer Docs:**
   - `docs/ai-personas-extension.md` (new) ‚Äì how to add or tweak personas, file structure overview, testing checklist.
   - Code samples for: adding new prompt file, registering in `personaRegistry`, extending UI metadata.

3. **Deployment Tasks:**
   - Ensure environment variable `PERSONA_DEFAULT=strategist` is set (optional override).
   - Roll updated API route and prompts to staging ‚Üí prod.
   - Smoke-test the live endpoint with at least one request per persona (script `scripts/smoke-test-personas.ts`).

4. **Release Notes:**
   - Add entry in `CHANGELOG.md` under *vNext* with feature summary and migration pointers.

*Skipped:* real-time monitoring dashboards and user-feedback loop will be handled in a later iteration.
