# PROCESSORS_RETAIL.md - Complete Processor Analysis Guide

This document provides comprehensive information about all analysis processors in the MPIQ AI Chat system, including their scoring formulas, methodologies, and specific relevance to retail market analysis.

## Overview

The system contains **35 total processors** organized into different categories:
- **22 Successfully Migrated Processors** (using BaseProcessor architecture)
- **9 Generic/Technical Processors** (ML utilities, no migration required)
- **2 Retail-Specific Processors** (BrandDifferenceProcessor, CompetitiveDataProcessor - available for retail projects)
- **2 Utility Files** (BaseProcessor, support files)

## Two-Layer Scoring Architecture Summary

**ðŸš€ CRITICAL: Understanding the Scoring Process**

The system uses a sophisticated two-layer architecture that separates AI intelligence from visualization:

### Layer 1: Automation Script Scoring
**File**: `/scripts/automation/automated_score_calculator.py`
- **Input**: Raw microservice data + **pre-calculated SHAP values** from microservice
- **Process**: Combines demographic data, SHAP feature importance, and domain-specific formulas
- **Output**: Processor-specific scores (e.g., `competitive_advantage_score`, `demographic_opportunity_score`)
- **SHAP Usage**: Uses existing SHAP values in weighted calculations for explainable AI scoring

### Layer 2: Processor Visualization Scoring
**File**: `/lib/analysis/strategies/processors/`
- **Input**: **Automation-generated scores** (NOT raw SHAP values)
- **Process**: Transforms automation scores into final visualization-ready data
- **Output**: Map styling, legends, and user-facing scores
- **Purpose**: Focuses on user experience and visualization preparation

### Key Points:
1. **SHAP values are PRE-CALCULATED** by the microservice for each endpoint
2. **Automation script USES** these SHAP values to generate processor-specific scores
3. **Processors CONSUME** the automation-generated scores, not raw SHAP values
4. This separation provides both explainable AI rigor AND performance optimization

*All formulas shown in this document represent the automation layer calculations that generate the scores processors consume.*

## Data Pipeline and Microservice Integration

### Complete Data Flow Architecture

1. **Target Variable Definition**:
   - Nike Brand Analysis: `target_variable = "MP30034A_B_P"` 
   - Adidas Brand Analysis: `target_variable = "MP30029A_B_P"`
   - Target represents market share percentage in each geographic area

2. **Microservice Data Extraction** (`enhanced_analysis_worker.py`):
   ```python
   # Extract target value from microservice data
   target_val = safe_float(row[target_variable])
   result['target_value'] = target_val  # Used by all processors
   result[clean_field_name] = target_val  # Nike/Adidas specific field
   ```

3. **SHAP Value Generation**:
   - **Endpoint**: `/factor-importance` with `method: "shap"`
   - **Purpose**: Generates explainable AI feature importance for target variable
   - **Format**: SHAP values stored as `shap_{field_name}` (e.g., `shap_ASIAN_CY_P`)
   - **Usage**: Multiple processors use SHAP values for scoring (CompetitiveDataProcessor, FeatureImportanceRankingProcessor)

4. **Field Extraction Pattern**:
   ```python
   # Demographic fields: Population, ethnicity, age distribution
   # Target fields: Project-specific metrics (brand share, property values, etc.)
   # SHAP fields: shap_{field_name} for explainable AI feature importance
   # Economic fields: Income, wealth indices, economic indicators
   ```

5. **Automation Pipeline** (`automated_score_calculator.py`):
   - Processes microservice data through multiple scoring algorithms
   - Integrates SHAP values for explainable scoring
   - Generates processor-specific scores using actual formulas
   - Outputs comprehensive analysis data for visualization

### Microservice Role and Purpose

The **SHAP Demographic Analytics Microservice** serves as the core data intelligence engine:

- **Data Source**: Comprehensive demographic, economic, and brand fields per geographic area
- **AI Processing**: Machine learning models with SHAP explainability
- **Target Analysis**: Configurable target variables based on project requirements
- **Outputs**: Raw data + SHAP feature importance + correlation analysis
- **Integration**: Feeds processed data to analysis processors

The microservice is essential because it provides both the raw market data AND the explainable AI insights that make processor scoring scientifically rigorous rather than just heuristic calculations.
