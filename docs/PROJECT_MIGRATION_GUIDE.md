```

---

## ⚠️ **STEP 2: REMAINING MANUAL CONFIGURATION** *(7-15 minutes)*

Only **3 manual steps** remain, requiring domain knowledge that cannot be automated:

### **2.1 Geographic Data Updates** *(5-10 minutes)*
**Required when**: Migrating to different geographic regions

**File**: `/lib/geo/GeoDataManager.ts`

**What to update:**

```typescript
// Replace existing geographic hierarchy with your project area

// 1. Update States
const states = [
  { name: 'YourState', abbr: 'XX', aliases: ['XX', 'State Nickname'] }
];

// 2. Update Counties  
const counties = [
  {
    name: 'Your County',
    aliases: ['County Nickname'],
    cities: ['City1', 'City2', 'City3']
  }
];

// 3. Update Cities with ZIP Codes
const cities = [
  {
    name: 'Your City',
    aliases: ['City Nickname'],
    parentCounty: 'your county',
    zipCodes: ['12345', '12346', '12347'] // Real ZIP codes
  }
];

// 4. Update Metro Areas
const metros = [
  {
    name: 'Your Metro Area', 
    aliases: ['Greater YourCity'],
    childEntities: ['County1', 'County2']
  }
];
```

**How to find your data:**
- **ZIP Codes**: Use USPS ZIP code lookup or your data source documentation
- **Counties**: Reference your state's official county list  
- **Metro Areas**: Use Bureau of Labor Statistics MSA definitions
- **City Names**: Match exactly with how they appear in your dataset

**Skip if**: Staying in the same geographic region as previous project

---

### **2.2 Competitor Brand Configuration** *(2-5 minutes)*  
**Required for**: Competitive analysis accuracy

**File**: `/lib/analysis/utils/BrandNameResolver.ts`

**What to update:**

```typescript
// Add your project's competitor brands
const COMPETITOR_BRANDS = [
  { fieldName: 'MP14029A_B_P', brandName: 'Monster Energy' },    // Main competitor
  { fieldName: 'MP28646A_B_P', brandName: '5-Hour Energy' },    // Alternative
  { fieldName: 'YOUR_FIELD_CODE', brandName: 'Your Competitor' } // Your discovery
];
```

**How to find competitor field codes:**
1. **Check your ArcGIS data source** for available brand fields
2. **Look for MP codes** that represent competitor brands
3. **Verify field names** match your dataset exactly
4. **Test with sample queries** to confirm accuracy

**Skip if**: Only tracking target brand performance (competitive analysis disabled)

---

### **2.3 Geographic Boundary Files Upload** *(10-30 minutes)*
**Required for**: Choropleth mapping (colored geographic regions)

**Files needed:**
```bash
public/data/boundaries/zip_boundaries.json     # US ZIP boundaries (5-50MB)
public/data/boundaries/fsa_boundaries.json     # Canadian boundaries (optional)
```

**Data sources:**
- **US Census Bureau**: https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html
- **Statistics Canada**: https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/
- **Commercial providers**: Esri, MapBox, Natural Earth Data

**File format requirements:**
```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection", 
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "properties": {
        "ZCTA5CE10": "90210"  // ZIP code property
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [[[lng, lat], [lng, lat], ...]]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Skip if**: Using point-based analysis only (no choropleth maps needed)

---

## 🧪 **STEP 3: VALIDATION & TESTING** *(2-3 minutes)*

### **3.1 Test Microservice Health**

```bash
# Check microservice is running
curl https://your-project-microservice.onrender.com/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy"}

# Test API endpoints
curl https://your-project-microservice.onrender.com/docs
# Expected: Interactive API documentation
```

### **3.2 Test Application Integration**

```bash
# Start your main application
npm run dev

# Navigate to analysis pages:
# - Strategic Analysis  
# - Competitive Analysis
# - Demographic Analysis

# Verify:
# ✅ Data loads without errors
# ✅ Analysis results display correctly
# ✅ No console errors in browser
```

### **3.3 Run Automated Tests**

```bash
# Test hybrid routing accuracy (automated during pipeline)
npm test -- __tests__/hybrid-routing-detailed.test.ts

# Expected: 100% routing accuracy for predefined queries
# Generated: Test reports in project directory
```

---

## 🔍 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues**

**Problem**: Migration fails at validation step
```bash
# Solution: Check prerequisites
npm run validate-migration-readiness --verbose
```

**Problem**: ArcGIS data extraction fails  
```bash
# Solution: Verify ArcGIS URL and permissions
curl "https://your-arcgis-url/FeatureServer?f=json"
```

**Problem**: Microservice deployment fails
```bash
# Solution: Check GitHub repository and Render account
# Verify: GitHub token and Render API access
```

**Problem**: Sample areas show wrong geographic data
```bash
# Solution: Update geographic configuration
# Edit: microservice-config.json -> geographic_configuration.sample_cities
```

**Problem**: Competitive analysis shows zeros
```bash
# Solution: Add competitor brands to BrandNameResolver
# Edit: /lib/analysis/utils/BrandNameResolver.ts -> COMPETITOR_BRANDS
