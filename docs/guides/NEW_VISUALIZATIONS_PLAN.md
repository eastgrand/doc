Excellent question! There are several other advanced query types that would make perfect sense to add and that SHAP can handle very well. Let me analyze the capabilities and suggest some high-value additions:

## üéØ **High-Value Advanced Query Types to Add**

### **1. Outlier Detection Queries** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
*"What areas are unusual outliers?" / "Show me anomalous regions"*

**SHAP Capability**: SHAP can identify features that contribute most to outlier behavior
```python
# SHAP can detect which features make areas statistically unusual
outlier_contributions = shap_values[outlier_indices]
```

**Value**: Critical for identifying data quality issues, unique opportunities, or areas needing investigation

**‚úÖ Implementation Status**: 
- ‚úÖ SHAP microservice endpoint: `/outlier-detection`
- ‚úÖ Query pattern detection in Claude route
- ‚úÖ Full integration with SHAP explanations
- ‚úÖ Multiple detection methods: isolation_forest, iqr, zscore
- ‚úÖ Detailed outlier analysis with feasibility assessment

---

### **2. Scenario Analysis Queries** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
*"What would happen if income increased by 20%?" / "How would crime change if education improved?"*

**SHAP Capability**: SHAP can simulate feature changes and predict outcomes
```python
# Modify feature values and see prediction changes
modified_features = X.copy()
modified_features['income'] *= 1.2
new_predictions = model.predict(modified_features)
```

**Value**: Strategic planning, policy impact analysis, investment decisions

**‚úÖ Implementation Status**: 
- ‚úÖ SHAP microservice endpoint: `/scenario-analysis`
- ‚úÖ Query pattern detection in Claude route
- ‚úÖ Full integration with SHAP-powered predictions
- ‚úÖ Default scenario generation for common what-if questions
- ‚úÖ Feasibility assessment and impact quantification

---

### **3. Feature Interaction Queries** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
*"How do income and education work together?" / "What combinations drive the highest rates?"*

**SHAP Capability**: SHAP interaction values show how features work together
```python
# SHAP can calculate interaction effects between features
shap_interaction_values = explainer.shap_interaction_values(X)
```

**Value**: Understanding complex relationships, optimizing multi-factor strategies

**‚úÖ Implementation Status**: COMPLETE - Already implemented and working

---

### **4. Threshold Analysis Queries** üöß **NEXT PRIORITY**
*"What income level predicts high property values?" / "At what point does density become problematic?"*

**SHAP Capability**: SHAP can identify critical thresholds where behavior changes
```python
# Analyze SHAP values across different ranges to find inflection points
threshold_analysis = analyze_shap_by_bins(feature_values, shap_values)
```

**Value**: Setting targets, understanding tipping points, resource allocation

---

### **5. Segment Profiling Queries** üöß **FUTURE**
*"What characterizes high-performing areas?" / "Profile the top 10% vs bottom 10%"*

**SHAP Capability**: Compare SHAP explanations across different segments
```python
# Compare SHAP patterns between high and low performing segments
top_segment_shap = shap_values[top_performers]
bottom_segment_shap = shap_values[bottom_performers]
```

**Value**: Strategic insights, targeted interventions, market segmentation

## üé® **Current Query Patterns**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Outlier Detection - IMPLEMENTED
const isOutlierQuery = /(?:outlier|anomal|unusual|strange|weird|different).*(?:area|region|place)/i.test(query) ||
                       /(?:what|which).*(?:area|region).*(?:stand out|different|unusual)/i.test(query);

// ‚úÖ Scenario Analysis - IMPLEMENTED
const isScenarioQuery = /(?:what if|if.*increase|if.*decrease|scenario|simulate)/i.test(query) ||
                        /(?:what would happen|how would.*change|impact of)/i.test(query);

// ‚úÖ Feature Interactions - COMPLETE
const isInteractionQuery = /(?:interaction|combination|together|combined|synerg|amplif).*(?:effect|impact|influence)/i.test(query) ||
                           /how.*(?:work|combine|interact).*together/i.test(query);

// üöß Threshold Analysis - TODO
const isThresholdQuery = /(?:what level|at what point|threshold|cutoff|minimum|maximum)/i.test(query) ||
                         /(?:how much.*needed|what.*required)/i.test(query);
```

## üí° **Testing the New Features**

### **Test Outlier Detection**
Try queries like:
- "What areas are unusual outliers for mortgage approvals?"
- "Show me anomalous regions with strange patterns"
- "Which areas stand out as different?"

### **Test Scenario Analysis**
Try queries like:
- "What if income increased by 20%?"
- "How would mortgage approvals change if education improved?"
- "What would happen to conversion rates if demographics shifted?"

Both features are now fully integrated with SHAP-powered analysis and should provide detailed, actionable insights with statistical backing!
