# Enhanced Query Testing Pipeline Guide

## Overview

The Enhanced Query Testing Engine validates the complete query-to-visualization pipeline, ensuring that user queries will work correctly from parsing to display. This goes far beyond basic query classification to test the entire flow:

1. **Field Parsing & Extraction** - Are fields correctly identified from queries?
2. **Query Classification** - Is the visualization type correctly selected?
3. **Visualization Validation** - Can the visualization be created with available fields?
4. **Display Validation** - Will the visualization render correctly?

## Pipeline Stages Validated

### Stage 1: Field Parsing & Extraction
**What it tests:**
- Query parsing extracts correct field names
- Field aliases are properly mapped
- Required fields are available in the configuration
- Field naming consistency across layers

**Example validation:**
```typescript
Query: "Show correlation between income and population"
✅ Extracted fields: ["income", "population"]
✅ Field mappings: {"income": "INCOME_FIELD", "population": "POPULATION_FIELD"}
✅ Fields found in configuration: true
```

**Failure scenarios:**
- ❌ No fields extracted from query
- ❌ Fields not found in available configuration
- ❌ Field alias mapping failures

### Stage 2: Query Classification
**What it tests:**
- Query is classified to correct visualization type
- Classification confidence meets minimum threshold
- Expected layers and fields are identified
- Classification patterns work with new configuration

**Example validation:**
```typescript
Query: "Show me the top 10 areas by income"
✅ Classification: TOP_N
✅ Confidence: 0.85 (above 0.7 threshold)
✅ Target field: "income"
✅ Expected behavior: Ranking visualization
```

**Failure scenarios:**
- ❌ Low classification confidence
- ❌ Wrong visualization type selected
- ❌ Classification errors or timeouts

### Stage 3: Visualization Validation
**What it tests:**
- Selected visualization type is compatible with extracted fields
- Required fields are available for renderer creation
- Field types match visualization requirements
- Renderer can be successfully created

**Example validation:**
```typescript
Visualization: CORRELATION
Required fields: 2 numeric fields
Available fields: ["income" (double), "population" (integer)]
✅ Field compatibility: Compatible
✅ Renderer validation: Can create correlation renderer
✅ Minimum field requirements: Met (2 >= 2)
```

**Failure scenarios:**
- ❌ Insufficient fields for visualization type
- ❌ Incompatible field types (e.g., string fields for numeric visualization)
- ❌ Renderer creation would fail

### Stage 4: Display Validation
**What it tests:**
- Visualization will display correctly
- No renderer configuration errors
- Symbol and styling configurations are valid
- Popup and legend configurations work

**Example validation:**
```typescript
Display validation:
✅ Renderer configuration: Valid
✅ Symbol definitions: Complete
✅ Color schemes: Available
✅ Popup templates: Configured
⚠️  Warning: Query involves many fields - visualization may be complex
```

**Failure scenarios:**
- ❌ Missing symbol configurations
- ❌ Invalid color scheme definitions
- ❌ Broken popup templates

## Test Categories

### Critical Queries (Must Pass)
These are fundamental queries that must work for basic functionality:

```typescript
const criticalQueries = [
  {
    query: "Show me all areas",
    expectedType: "CHOROPLETH",
    description: "Basic area display"
  },
  {
    query: "Show correlation between income and population", 
    expectedType: "CORRELATION",
    description: "Basic correlation analysis"
  },
  {
    query: "Show me the top 10 areas by income",
    expectedType: "TOP_N", 
    description: "Ranking functionality"
  }
];
```

### Configuration-Specific Queries (Auto-Generated)
These are generated based on your specific layer configuration:

```typescript
// For each layer in configuration
"Show me [LayerName]" → CHOROPLETH test
"Analyze [LayerName] distribution" → Distribution test

// For each group in configuration  
"Show me [GroupName] data" → Group display test

// Cross-layer tests
"Show correlation between [Layer1] and [Layer2]" → Correlation test
```

### Advanced Query Tests (Optional)
Complex analysis patterns that enhance user experience:

```typescript
const advancedQueries = [
  "Analyze the relationship between income, education, and housing" → MULTIVARIATE,
  "Find areas with both high income and high education" → JOINT_HIGH,
  "Compare income and education across neighborhoods" → COMPARISON
];
```

## Pipeline Health Report

The testing provides a comprehensive health report showing success rates at each stage:

```
📈 Pipeline Health Report:
  - Field Parsing: 95.2% success rate
  - Query Classification: 89.7% success rate  
  - Visualization Selection: 91.3% success rate
  - Display Validation: 88.9% success rate

Overall Success Rate: 91% (10/11 tests passed)
Critical Tests: ✅ PASSED (4/4)
```

## What Makes This Different

### Traditional Query Testing
- ✅ Tests query classification only
- ✅ Validates concept mapping
- ❌ Doesn't test visualization creation
- ❌ Doesn't validate field compatibility
- ❌ Doesn't check display rendering

### Enhanced Pipeline Testing  
- ✅ Tests complete query-to-visualization flow
- ✅ Validates field parsing and extraction
- ✅ Checks visualization compatibility
- ✅ Validates renderer creation capability
- ✅ Tests display rendering validation
- ✅ Provides stage-specific failure analysis
- ✅ Offers actionable recommendations

## Practical Benefits

### 1. Deployment Confidence
**Before:** "Hope the queries work after deployment"
**After:** "Know exactly which queries will work and why"

### 2. Issue Prevention
**Before:** Users discover broken queries after deployment
**After:** Issues identified and fixed before deployment

### 3. Targeted Fixes
**Before:** Generic "check your configuration" advice
**After:** Specific recommendations like:
- "Add field alias for 'population' → 'POPULATION_FIELD'"
- "Ensure correlation visualization has 2+ numeric fields"
- "Check renderer configuration for TOP_N visualization"

### 4. Performance Insights
Track exactly where queries fail in the pipeline:
```
Pipeline Stage Failures:
- Parsing: 2 queries (field mapping issues)
- Classification: 1 query (low confidence)  
- Visualization: 3 queries (field compatibility)
- Display: 1 query (renderer configuration)
```

## Example Test Results

### Successful Query Flow
```
Query: "Show correlation between income and education"

Stage 1 - Field Parsing: ✅ PASSED
- Extracted fields: ["income", "education"]
- Field mappings: {"income": "INCOME_FIELD", "education": "EDUCATION_FIELD"}
- All fields found in configuration

Stage 2 - Classification: ✅ PASSED  
- Classification: CORRELATION
- Confidence: 0.87
- Meets minimum threshold (0.6)

Stage 3 - Visualization: ✅ PASSED
- Field compatibility: Compatible (2 numeric fields)
- Renderer validation: Can create correlation renderer
- Required fields: Available

Stage 4 - Display: ✅ PASSED
- Renderer configuration: Valid
- Symbol definitions: Complete
- Display validation: No issues

Result: ✅ COMPLETE PIPELINE SUCCESS
```

### Failed Query Flow with Recommendations
```
Query: "Show relationship between location and demographics"

Stage 1 - Field Parsing: ❌ FAILED
- Extracted fields: ["location", "demographics"]  
- Field mappings: {"location": "location", "demographics": "demographics"}
- Missing fields: ["location", "demographics"]

Issues:
- Field "location" not found in available fields
- Field "demographics" not found in available fields

Recommendations:
- Add field alias: "location" → "GEOGRAPHIC_FIELD"
- Add field alias: "demographics" → "DEMOGRAPHIC_FIELD"  
- Check field naming consistency across layers

Result: ❌ FAILED AT PARSING STAGE
```
