# Non-Technical Overview

## What the Platform Does
Enter a natural-language question about geographic data and instantly receive:
1. A colourful map highlighting the relevant areas.
2. A plain-English explanation of what the data means.

## AI Personas
Before asking, pick a persona to shape the answer's viewpoint:
| Persona | Typical Focus |
|---------|---------------|
| Strategist | Market expansion & long-term growth |
| Tactician | Day-to-day operations & efficiency |
| Creative | New ideas and emerging trends |
| Product Specialist | Product features & user experience |
| Customer Advocate | Customer satisfaction & service |

## How a Question Becomes a Map (Query-to-Visualization System)
1. **Crunch the numbers** – A statistical engine analyses your requested data (e.g. finds the top ZIP codes for Nike sales).
2. **Tell the story** – A language model turns those numbers into a short narrative aligned with your chosen persona.
3. **Show the picture** – The map paints the results so you can see patterns at a glance.
Both the text and the map use exactly the same data slice, so they never disagree.

## Why You Can Trust the Results
* Each sample question used in demos is automatically re-tested whenever we update the software.
* Quick "smoke tests" run after every deployment to ensure every persona still works.
* Previous issues—like invalid numbers or wrong query types—have been fixed and documented.

In short, the app translates everyday questions into accurate geographic insights and visuals, spoken in the voice that best fits your role.
