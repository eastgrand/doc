# TODO List - January 9, 2025

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Map Visualization Rendering Issue
- [ ] The map visualization is not rendering correctly again (full project request has missing features and possible overlapping layers)
- [ ] Search for previous fix notes in the 01_ARCGIS_DATA_AUTOMATION_PLAND doc and other docs
- [ ] Review git history for related fixes (I don't think this ever got pushed to git and has since been reverted)

### 2. Loading Page Text Updates
- [ ] Remove dates from "data refreshed" text
- [ ] Add more interesting, project-specific facts
- [ ] Focus on stats/analysis/facts rather than how the app works
- [ ] Increase variety of facts displayed
- [ ] Research performance impact of fetching actual data from datasets on each load
- [ ] Implement dynamic fact generation if performance allows

### 3. Bookmarks Widget - Quebec Cities
- [ ] Update bookmarks from California cities to Quebec cities:
  - Montreal
  - Quebec City
  - Laval
  - Gatineau
- [ ] Previous request was made but not implemented

### 4. Layer List Widget Issues
- [ ] Fix groups and layers organization
- [ ] Debug and fix the mechanism to hide layers from widget (currently not working)
- [ ] Review existing layer filtering logic

### 5. Composite Index Layers Integration
- [ ] Complete implementation of adding composite index layers to layer list widget
- [ ] Search for existing code (layers are created and loaded differently than others)
- [ ] Integrate with layer list properly

### 6. Canadian Infographics
- [ ] Update infographics to use Canadian data
- [ ] Replace US-specific content with Canadian equivalents

### 7. Distance Units for Walk/Drive Time Tools
- [ ] Ensure kilometers (km) is available as a unit option
- [ ] Add km alongside miles in walk and drive-time tools

### 8. Quick Stats/Sample Area Panel Solution
- [ ] Develop different solution for quick stats/sample area panel
- [ ] Address current implementation issues

## Notes
- Multiple issues appear to be regressions of previously fixed problems
- Check previous documentation and commits for solutions
- Priority should be given to map visualization as it affects core functionality
