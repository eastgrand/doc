# Endpoint Scoring Algorithms Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive reference for all 26 analysis endpoints, their optimized scoring algorithms, and the methodology used to create them. Each algorithm is specifically tailored to the business purpose of its endpoint.

## Algorithm Generation Methodology

### Data-Driven SHAP Approach
All scoring algorithms are generated using a data-driven methodology based on SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) feature importance analysis:

1. **Field Analysis**: Analyze all 55 available fields in the dataset
2. **Duplicate Field Exclusion**: Exclude `thematic_value` as it duplicates other data in the dataset
3. **Percentage Preference**: Automatically prefer percentage fields (`_P` suffix) over count fields when both exist
4. **Relevance Scoring**: Apply business-purpose-specific bonuses based on endpoint requirements
5. **Multi-Field Selection**: Select 3-7 most relevant fields per endpoint
6. **Weight Distribution**: Calculate weights based on statistical importance and business relevance
7. **Algorithm Generation**: Create unique mathematical formulas for each endpoint

**Solution**: Use most variable static fields as proxies for trend potential (lower confidence)

### Geographic Analysis
**Affected Endpoints**: Spatial Clusters  
**Clarification**: Clustering based on business performance similarity, not geographic proximity  
**Rationale**: Geographic coordinates available but business clustering more valuable

**Frequency**: When underlying data changes or business requirements evolve  
**Validation**: Automatic validation with `algorithm_validator.py`

### Field Optimization
**Percentage Priority**: Automatically maintained through `_prefer_percentage_fields()` method
