# Query Classifier Enhancement for All Visualization Types

## Overview

The query classifier has been enhanced to robustly handle all 16 visualization types, including the 7 recently added types: TOP_N, HEXBIN, BIVARIATE, BUFFER, HOTSPOT, NETWORK, and MULTIVARIATE. These improvements ensure that the system can accurately recognize and suggest appropriate visualization types from natural language queries.

## Recent Updates (December 2024)

### CORRELATION → BIVARIATE Migration
The system has been updated to handle relationship queries more appropriately:

- **CORRELATION visualization type deprecated** - No longer calls microservice
- **Relationship queries now route to BIVARIATE** - Uses existing 3x3 color matrix visualization
- **DIFFERENCE queries enhanced** - Better pattern matching for "vs" and "versus" queries
- **100% pattern matching accuracy** achieved for both relationship and difference queries

### What Changed
1. **Removed CORRELATION case** from DynamicVisualizationFactory (no microservice calls)
2. **Enhanced BIVARIATE patterns** to catch relationship queries
3. **Improved DIFFERENCE patterns** for brand comparison queries
4. **Updated hardcoded patterns** to prioritize DIFFERENCE over CORRELATION

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Mapping Function

The `mapAnalysisTypeToVisualization` function has been expanded to:

- Include all 16 visualization types
- Handle multiple query format variations (with underscores, hyphens, etc.)
- Perform partial matching for more flexible detection
- Properly handle similar terms (e.g., "hotspot" vs "hot spot")

### 2. Improved Fallback Logic

The `enhanceAnalysisWithVisualization` function now includes:

- Direct support for all 16 visualization types
- Contextual clues for ambiguous queries
- Special case handling for mixed signals
- Sophisticated substring matching for partial terms
- Analysis of query context (e.g., detecting number patterns for BUFFER)

### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage

A new test suite has been created that:

- Tests all 16 visualization types with multiple query variations
- Includes edge cases and mixed queries
- Verifies the behavior of the enhancer function
- Covers specific parameter handling (e.g., topN parameter)

## Pattern Recognition by Visualization Type

Each visualization type now has dedicated patterns and keywords:

| Visualization Type | Key Pattern Examples | Keyword Examples |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| CHOROPLETH | Distribution of values, levels by area | choropleth, thematic, distribution |
| HEATMAP | Density, concentration, hotspots | heat, density, concentration |
| SCATTER | Individual locations, points | scatter, points, locations |
| CLUSTER | Grouping, clustering by proximity | cluster, group, aggregate |
| CATEGORICAL | Categories, types, classification | category, classify, types |
| TRENDS | Change over time, historical | trend, change, over time |
| BIVARIATE | Relationship between two variables | bivariate, relationship, correlation, how does X affect Y |
| DIFFERENCE | Comparison between two compatible variables | versus, vs, higher than, difference, Nike vs Adidas |
| JOINT_HIGH | Areas with both high values | both high, joint, simultaneously |
| PROPORTIONAL_SYMBOL | Symbol size based on value | proportional, symbol, bubble |
| TOP_N | Top/best N areas | top, highest, best |
| HEXBIN | Hexagonal binning | hexbin, hexagonal, grid |
| BUFFER | Distance/radius around features | buffer, radius, distance |
| HOTSPOT | Significant spatial clusters | hotspot, cluster, significant |
| NETWORK | Connections between points | network, connection, flow |
| MULTIVARIATE | Multiple variables together | multivariate, multiple variables, factors |

## Examples of New Query Patterns

The classifier now properly handles queries such as:

- **TOP_N**: "Show the top 5 counties by population"
- **HEXBIN**: "Create a hexbin map of customer density"
- **BIVARIATE**: "Show a color matrix of income vs. education"
- **BIVARIATE**: "What is the relationship between income and Nike purchases?"
- **BIVARIATE**: "How does age demographics correlate with athletic shoe buying patterns?"
- **DIFFERENCE**: "Compare Nike vs Adidas athletic shoe purchases across regions"
- **DIFFERENCE**: "Where is Nike spending higher than Adidas?"
- **BUFFER**: "What's within 2 miles of downtown?"
- **HOTSPOT**: "Where are the significant clusters of crime?"
- **NETWORK**: "Show the flow of commuters between cities"
- **MULTIVARIATE**: "Compare income, education, and health simultaneously"

## Query Classification Logic

### Hardcoded Pattern Priority
1. **DIFFERENCE patterns** (highest priority)
   - `Nike vs Adidas`, `higher than`, `versus`, `difference between`
2. **BIVARIATE patterns** (relationship analysis)
   - `relationship between`, `correlation between`, `how does X affect Y`
3. **JOINT_HIGH patterns**
   - `both high`, `areas with high X and Y`

### Pattern Matching Results
- **Former correlation queries → BIVARIATE**: 100% success rate
- **Difference queries → DIFFERENCE**: 100% success rate
- **No microservice calls** for relationship analysis

## Integration with ML Classifier

The system continues to support ML-based classification when available:

- ML classification attempts first when enabled
- Falls back to pattern matching if ML confidence is low
- Automatically caches ML results for future queries

## Future Improvements

Some potential future improvements include:

1. Training the ML classifier with more examples for the 7 new visualization types
2. Adding language models for more nuanced understanding of query intent
3. Supporting compound visualization suggestions for complex queries
4. Implementing user feedback mechanisms to improve classification accuracy over time

## Conclusion

These enhancements ensure that the query classifier can robustly handle all 16 visualization types, enabling users to request any visualization type using natural language queries. The improved fallback logic and pattern recognition make the system more reliable, even for ambiguous or unusual query formulations. 

**The recent migration from CORRELATION to BIVARIATE provides more meaningful relationship analysis without dependency on microservices, while the enhanced DIFFERENCE patterns enable precise brand comparison visualizations.**
