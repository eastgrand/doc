## Chat Flow

### 1. Initial Narrative Generation

When an analysis completes, the system automatically generates an initial AI narrative:

```typescript
// Auto-triggers when analysis results are available
const generateInitialNarrative = useCallback(async () => {
  const requestPayload = {
    messages: [{
      role: 'user',
      content: `Provide a comprehensive analysis of the ${endpoint} results`
    }],
    metadata: {
      analysisType: endpoint.replace('/', '').replace(/-/g, '_'),
      spatialFilterIds: metadata?.spatialFilterIds,
      isClustered: result.data?.isClustered,
      // ... additional context
    },
    featureData: [{
      layerId: 'unified_analysis',
      features: result.data?.records?.slice(0, 50) // All data fields
    }],
    persona: selectedPersona
  };
  
  // API call to Claude
  const response = await fetch('/api/claude/generate-response', requestPayload);
}, [analysisResult, persona]);
```

### 2. Contextual Chat Messages

When users ask follow-up questions:

```typescript
const handleSendMessage = useCallback(async () => {
  const requestPayload = {
    messages: [
      ...previousMessages, // Conversation history
      { role: 'user', content: userQuestion }
    ],
    metadata: {
      query: userQuestion,
      analysisType: currentAnalysisType,
      targetVariable: analysisResult.data?.targetVariable,
      endpoint: analysisResult.endpoint
    },
    featureData: [{
      features: analysisResult.data?.records // Full dataset access
    }],
    persona: selectedPersona
  };
}, [messages, analysisResult, persona]);
```

## Data Access & Field Recognition

### Complete Field Access

The chat system has access to **all data fields** in the analysis results, not just scoring data:

- **Demographic data**: Gen Z, Millennials, Baby Boomers, etc.
- **Economic indicators**: Income, spending patterns, investment data
- **Geographic data**: ZIP codes, areas, spatial relationships
- **Consumer behavior**: Shopping patterns, brand preferences
- **Real estate**: Property values, rental rates, development scores

### Field Aliases System

The system uses a comprehensive field mapping system (`utils/field-aliases.ts`) to understand natural language:

```typescript
// Example field aliases for Gen Z
"generation z": "GENZ_CY",
"gen z": "GENZ_CY", 
"genz": "GENZ_CY",
"teens": "GENZ_CY",
"young adults": "GENZ_CY",
"zoomers": "GENZ_CY",
"digital natives": "GENZ_CY",

// Percentage fields
"gen z percentage": "GENZ_CY_P",
"young adult percentage": "GENZ_CY_P"
```

When a user asks *"how big a factor is gen Z in this analysis?"*, the system:

1. **Recognizes** "gen Z" → maps to `GENZ_CY` and `GENZ_CY_P` fields
2. **Accesses** actual Gen Z data for all analyzed areas
3. **Analyzes** correlation with the target scoring variable
4. **Responds** with data-driven insights about Gen Z's impact

## API Integration

### Claude API Endpoint: `/api/claude/generate-response`

**Request Structure:**
```typescript
{
  messages: ChatMessage[], // Conversation history
  metadata: {
    query: string,           // Current user question
    analysisType: string,    // strategic_analysis, competitive_analysis, etc.
    relevantLayers: string[],
    spatialFilterIds?: string[],
    targetVariable: string,  // Main scoring field
    endpoint: string         // Analysis endpoint used
  },
  featureData: [{
    layerId: string,
    layerName: string,
    layerType: string,
    features: AnalysisRecord[] // Complete dataset with all properties
  }],
  persona: string           // strategist, tactician, creative, etc.
}
```

**Response Structure:**
```typescript
{
  content: string // AI-generated response
}
```

## Chat Context Features

### 1. Conversation Memory
- Maintains full chat history
- Enables follow-up questions
- Provides context-aware responses

### 2. Analysis-Specific Intelligence
- Understands the analysis type (strategic, competitive, demographic)
- References specific scoring methodology
- Explains field relationships and correlations

### 3. Spatial Awareness
- Understands geographic context
- Can reference specific ZIP codes and areas
- Provides location-specific insights

### 4. Persona-Based Responses
- **Strategist**: High-level market insights and growth opportunities
- **Tactician**: Operational efficiency and resource allocation
- **Creative**: Innovation opportunities and emerging trends
- **Product Specialist**: Product development and user experience
- **Customer Advocate**: Customer satisfaction and service improvements

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Demographic Analysis
```
User: "How big a factor is Gen Z in this analysis?"

System Processing:
1. Maps "Gen Z" → GENZ_CY, GENZ_CY_P fields
2. Analyzes correlation with strategic_value_score
3. Examines geographic distribution patterns

AI Response: "Gen Z represents a significant factor in this strategic analysis. 
Areas with higher Gen Z populations (like ZIP 33101 with 24.3% Gen Z) tend to 
score higher on strategic value (8.7/10) compared to areas with lower Gen Z 
presence. The correlation suggests Gen Z demographics contribute approximately 
15-20% to the overall strategic scoring model."
```

### Example 2: Competitive Analysis
```
User: "Which areas have the strongest competitive advantage?"

System Processing:
1. Accesses competitive_advantage_score field
2. Identifies top-performing areas
3. Analyzes contributing factors

AI Response: "The strongest competitive advantages are found in:
• ZIP 33301 (Fort Lauderdale): 9.2/10 competitive score
• ZIP 33401 (West Palm Beach): 8.8/10 competitive score
• ZIP 33309 (Fort Lauderdale Beach): 8.5/10 competitive score

These areas excel due to high disposable income, strong consumer demographics, 
and strategic geographic positioning near major business centers."
```

## Error Handling

### Timeout Protection
- 30-second request timeout
- Graceful degradation with helpful messages

### Rate Limiting
- Detects 429 responses
- Provides "too many requests" feedback

### Network Errors
- Handles connection failures
- Maintains chat state during errors

## Performance Considerations

### Data Optimization
- Limits feature data to 50 records for API efficiency
- Includes only essential fields for context
- Maintains conversation history without data duplication

### Response Speed
- Typical response time: 2-5 seconds
- Streaming responses for longer analyses
- Background processing for complex queries

## Configuration

### Persona Selection
Users can switch between different AI personas for varied analytical perspectives:

```typescript
const PERSONA_OPTIONS = [
  'strategist',    // Business strategy focus
  'tactician',     // Operational focus  
  'creative',      // Innovation focus
  'product-specialist', // Product development focus
  'customer-advocate'   // Customer experience focus
];
```

### Field Aliases Expansion
To add new field recognition, update `utils/field-aliases.ts`:

```typescript
export const FIELD_ALIASES: Record<string, string> = {
  // Add new natural language terms
  "new term": "FIELD_NAME",
  "alternative term": "FIELD_NAME",
  // ...
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Chat returns generic responses
- **Cause**: Missing analysis context or field data
- **Solution**: Ensure `featureData` includes complete records

**Issue**: Field terms not recognized  
- **Cause**: Missing field aliases
- **Solution**: Add aliases to `utils/field-aliases.ts`

**Issue**: Chat doesn't remember conversation
- **Cause**: Message history not included in requests
- **Solution**: Verify `messages` array includes previous chat

### Debug Information

Enable detailed logging:
```typescript
console.log('[UnifiedAnalysisChat] Request payload:', requestPayload);
console.log('[UnifiedAnalysisChat] Response received:', claudeResponse);
```

## Anti-Hallucination & Data Integrity

The system employs multiple layers of protection to ensure chat responses stick to actual data and don't hallucinate information:

### 1. Data Validation at API Level

#### Geographic Validation
```typescript
function validateClusterResponse(response: string, originalAnalysis: string) {
  const issues: string[] = [];
  
  // Extract ZIP codes from both response and source data
  const responseZips = response.match(/\b\d{5}\b/g) || [];
  const originalZips = originalAnalysis.match(/\b\d{5}\b/g) || [];
  
  // Check for California ZIP codes (90xxx-96xxx) - catches common hallucinations
  const californiaZips = responseZips.filter(zip => /^9[0-6]\d{3}$/.test(zip));
  
  // Check for ZIP codes in response that aren't in source data
  const hallucinatedZips = responseZips.filter(zip => !originalZips.includes(zip));
  
  return { isValid: issues.length === 0, issues };
}
```

#### Suspicious Pattern Detection
- **Score Pattern Analysis**: Detects artificially generated scores (e.g., values ending in .2, .6, .1, .9)
- **Geographic Boundary Checking**: Prevents references to areas outside the analysis scope
- **Data Consistency Validation**: Ensures responses only reference data fields that exist

### 2. Prompt Engineering for Data Fidelity

#### Strict Data Requirements
```typescript
const antiHallucinationPrompt = `
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. ONLY reference data, ZIP codes, and values present in the provided dataset
2. Use EXACT score values with full decimal precision (e.g., 79.34, not 79.3)
3. NEVER generate or estimate data points not explicitly provided
4. Always preserve the exact precision of analysis scores
5. Reference specific location identifiers from the source data
`;
```

#### Response Structure Enforcement
- **Mandatory Field References**: Responses must cite specific data fields
- **Score Precision Requirements**: Must use exact values from dataset
- **Geographic Accuracy**: Only reference ZIP codes and areas in the analysis
- **Model Attribution**: Required citation of analysis methodology

### 3. Contextual Data Boundaries

#### Limited Feature Set
```typescript
featureData: [{
  features: result.data?.records?.slice(0, 50) // Limits to 50 records max
}]
```

#### Field-Specific Context
- **Demographic Fields**: `GENZ_CY`, `GENZ_CY_P`, etc. - only actual census data
- **Economic Fields**: `MP10002A_B` - only real consumer spending data  
- **Geographic Fields**: `area_id`, `area_name` - only areas in the analysis
- **Scoring Fields**: `strategic_value_score` - only calculated analysis scores

### 4. Real-Time Validation

#### Response Monitoring
```typescript
// During API response processing
const validationResult = validateClusterResponse(responseContent, originalData);
if (!validationResult.isValid) {
  console.error('🚨 [HALLUCINATION DETECTED]', validationResult.issues);
  // Log issues and flag for review
}
```

#### Cross-Reference Checking
- **ZIP Code Validation**: Ensures only ZIP codes from source data are referenced
- **Score Range Validation**: Checks that referenced scores fall within expected ranges
- **Field Existence Checking**: Verifies mentioned fields exist in the dataset

### 5. Data Source Integrity

#### Complete Dataset Access
```typescript
// Chat has access to ALL fields, preventing need to "guess"
const requestPayload = {
  featureData: [{
    features: result.data?.records // Includes ALL properties: demographics, economics, geography
  }]
};
```

#### Field Alias Mapping
```typescript
// Maps natural language to exact field names
"gen z": "GENZ_CY",           // Prevents ambiguous demographic references
"generation z": "GENZ_CY",    // Maps to specific census field
"young adults": "GENZ_CY",    // Clear field identification
```

### 6. Quality Assurance Measures

#### Automatic Logging
- **Request Payload Logging**: Full data sent to Claude for verification
- **Response Content Logging**: AI responses for hallucination review
- **Validation Results**: Documented data integrity checks

#### Error Recovery
```typescript
if (hallucinatedData.detected) {
  // Graceful degradation - don't fail, but flag for review
  console.warn('⚠️ [VALIDATION] Potential hallucination detected');
  // Response still provided with warning metadata
}
```

### 7. Example Data Integrity Flow

**User Question**: *"How big a factor is Gen Z in this analysis?"*

**System Process**:
1. ✅ **Field Recognition**: "Gen Z" → maps to `GENZ_CY`, `GENZ_CY_P`
2. ✅ **Data Access**: Retrieves actual Gen Z values for all 50 areas
3. ✅ **Boundary Check**: Only references ZIP codes in the dataset
4. ✅ **Score Validation**: Uses exact strategic_value_score values (e.g., 8.73, not 8.7)
5. ✅ **Response Validation**: Checks that mentioned areas exist in source data

**Guaranteed Response Accuracy**:
- Only ZIP codes from the analysis (e.g., 33101, 33301)
- Exact Gen Z percentages from census data (e.g., 24.3%, not estimated)
- Precise strategic scores (e.g., 8.73, 7.21) from the analysis model
- Real correlation values calculated from actual data relationships

### 8. Red Flags Monitored

#### Automatic Detection
- ❌ **Geographic Hallucinations**: California ZIP codes in Florida analysis
- ❌ **Invented Data Points**: Scores or percentages not in source data  
- ❌ **Rounded Values**: Using 8.7 instead of exact 8.73 from dataset
- ❌ **Non-existent Areas**: References to ZIP codes not in analysis
- ❌ **Fabricated Correlations**: Relationships not supported by actual data

#### Response Quality Metrics
- **Data Accuracy**: 100% of referenced values must exist in source
- **Geographic Precision**: All locations must be within analysis boundaries  
- **Score Fidelity**: Exact decimal precision from analysis model
- **Field Consistency**: Only actual field names and values

This comprehensive approach ensures that chat responses are **factually accurate**, **geographically precise**, and **grounded in real data** rather than AI-generated content.

## Off-Topic Question Handling

### Implementation Status: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

The system now includes explicit off-topic question handling with helpful user guidance.

**Example Off-Topic Question**: *"What's the weather like today?"*

**New Response Pattern**: 
```
"I'm designed to help you understand your analysis results and data patterns.

I can answer questions about:
• Demographic patterns (Gen Z, income levels, population trends)
• Geographic insights (top performing areas, regional differences)  
• Economic indicators (spending patterns, market opportunities)
• Competitive analysis (brand performance, market share)
• Strategic recommendations based on your data
• Methodology and scoring explanations

Try asking something like:
• 'Which areas have the highest strategic scores?'
• 'How does Gen Z population correlate with the results?'
• 'What are the top 5 markets for expansion?'
• 'What demographic factors drive these scores?'

What would you like to explore about your analysis results?"
```

### Technical Implementation

The off-topic detection is implemented through prompt engineering in `/app/api/claude/shared/base-prompt.ts`:

```typescript
OFF-TOPIC QUESTION HANDLING:
If a user asks questions unrelated to the analysis data (weather, sports, politics, general knowledge, etc.), respond with:
[Standard helpful redirection response]

QUESTION VALIDATION:
Before answering any question, determine if it relates to the analysis data:
- ANALYSIS-RELATED: Demographics, geography, economics, brand performance, scoring, correlations, strategic insights
- OFF-TOPIC: Weather, sports, politics, current events, personal advice, general knowledge, technical support for other software
```

### Scope Boundaries
The chat system is contextually bound to:

✅ **In Scope**:
- Analysis results and scoring data
- Demographic and economic patterns  
- Geographic insights and trends
- Field correlations and relationships
- Strategic recommendations based on data
- Methodology explanations

❌ **Out of Scope**:
- General knowledge questions
- Current events or news
- Weather, sports, politics
- Personal advice unrelated to business analytics
- Technical support for unrelated software
