## Migration Summary

### Successful Migrations (22 processors)
All core analysis processors have been successfully migrated from the legacy `DataProcessorStrategy` interface to extend the new `BaseProcessor` architecture. Each migrated processor includes:

1. **Architecture Migration**: Updated from `implements DataProcessorStrategy` to `extends BaseProcessor`
2. **Real Estate Adaptation**: Terminology and field mappings updated for housing market analysis
3. **Configuration Integration**: Integrated with `AnalysisConfigurationManager` for project type switching
4. **Field Mapping**: Updated to use Quebec housing market data fields (ECYHRIAVG, ECYPTAPOP, etc.)

### Project Type Compatibility
- **Retail Only**: 1 processor (BrandAnalysisProcessor - utility)
- **Real Estate Only**: 4 processors (specialized housing market analysis)
- **Both Retail & Real Estate**: 21 processors (generic analysis capabilities)
- **Generic (No Domain)**: 9 processors (technical/ML utilities)

The migration ensures comprehensive real estate analysis capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility for retail analysis when needed.
