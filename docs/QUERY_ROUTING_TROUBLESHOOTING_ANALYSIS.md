# Query Routing Troubleshooting Analysis

**Date**: August 22, 2025  
**Context**: Systematic analysis of routing accuracy issues discovered in comprehensive pipeline test  
**Current Routing Accuracy**: 13.6% (3/22 queries routing correctly)  
**Target**: 80%+ routing accuracy

## Overview

Our comprehensive test revealed that 86.4% of production queries are being routed incorrectly, primarily defaulting to `/analyze` instead of specialized endpoints. This represents a significant user experience issue where users receive generic analysis instead of targeted, specialized insights.

## Evidence of Production Impact

The test uses the same routing logic as production:
- **Production Flow**: Chat ‚Üí `UnifiedAnalysisWrapper` ‚Üí `AnalysisEngine.executeAnalysis()` ‚Üí `CachedEndpointRouter.route()`
- **Test Flow**: Direct call to `CachedEndpointRouter.route()` with same configuration
- **Same Queries**: Test uses actual `ANALYSIS_CATEGORIES` from `chat-constants.ts`

**This means production users are experiencing these routing issues right now.**

## Detailed Routing Failure Analysis

### üî¥ **HIGH-PRIORITY: Wrong Endpoint Confusion (2 cases)**

**Issue**: Queries getting routed to incorrect specialized endpoints

1. **Competitive vs Brand Difference Confusion**
   - **Query**: "Show me the market share difference between H&R Block and TurboTax"
   - **Expected**: `/competitive-analysis` 
   - **Actual**: `/brand-difference`
   - **Problem**: "market share difference" keywords triggering brand endpoint instead of competitive analysis

2. **Feature Interactions Misrouting**
   - **Query**: "Which markets have the strongest interactions between demographics and tax service usage?"
   - **Expected**: `/feature-interactions`
   - **Actual**: `/demographic-insights` 
   - **Problem**: "demographics" keyword overriding "interactions" specificity

**Impact**: Users get wrong type of analysis, potentially misleading insights

### üü° **MEDIUM-PRIORITY: AI/ML Endpoints Defaulting to /analyze (8 cases)**

**Issue**: All machine learning and AI-related queries defaulting to generic analysis

**Failed Queries**:
- "What are the most important factors predicting H&R Block online usage?" ‚Üí `/feature-importance-ranking`
- "How accurate are our predictions for tax service market performance?" ‚Üí `/model-performance`
- "Which AI model performs best for predicting tax service usage in each area?" ‚Üí `/algorithm-comparison`
- "Show me the highest confidence predictions using our best ensemble model" ‚Üí `/ensemble-analysis`
- "What is the optimal AI algorithm for predictions in each geographic area?" ‚Üí `/model-selection`
- "Which factors explain most of the variation in tax service market performance?" ‚Üí `/dimensionality-insights`
- "Where do all our AI models agree on tax service predictions?" ‚Üí `/consensus-analysis`
- "How do tax service rankings change if we adjust income weights by 20%?" ‚Üí `/sensitivity-analysis`

**Problem**: Missing keywords for AI/ML terminology in endpoint configurations

### üü† **MEDIUM-PRIORITY: Business Analysis Endpoints Defaulting to /analyze (9 cases)**

**Issue**: Business and analytical queries not matching specialized endpoints

**Failed Queries**:
- "Compare H&R Block usage between Alachua County and Miami-Dade County" ‚Üí `/comparative-analysis`
- "Show me areas with ideal customer personas for tax preparation services" ‚Üí `/customer-profile`
- "Show me geographic clusters of similar tax service markets" ‚Üí `/spatial-clusters`
- "Show me markets that have outliers with unique tax service characteristics" ‚Üí `/outlier-detection`
- "What if H&R Block changes its pricing strategy - which markets would be most resilient?" ‚Üí `/scenario-analysis`
- "Which markets have the clearest customer segmentation profiles for tax services?" ‚Üí `/segment-profiling`
- "Which unusual market patterns represent the biggest business opportunities?" ‚Üí `/anomaly-insights`
- "How should we segment tax service markets for targeted strategies?" ‚Üí `/cluster-analysis`

**Problem**: Missing business terminology and analytical concepts in keyword configurations

### ‚úÖ **WORKING CORRECTLY (3 cases)**

These queries routed correctly, showing the system can work:
- "Show me the top strategic markets for H&R Block tax service expansion" ‚Üí `/strategic-analysis`
- "Which areas have the best customer demographics for tax preparation services?" ‚Üí `/demographic-insights`
- "Provide comprehensive market insights for tax preparation services" ‚Üí `/analyze` (correct for general query)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Potential Issues Identified:

1. **Keyword Configuration Gaps**
   - Missing AI/ML terminology in endpoint configurations
   - Insufficient business analysis keywords
   - Need to add variations and synonyms

2. **Keyword Matching Logic**
   - Simple keyword matching may be too basic
   - Need to investigate scoring algorithm in `CachedEndpointRouter`
   - Possible issues with keyword priority/weighting

3. **Semantic Routing Fallback**
   - Semantic routing failing to browser environment limitations
   - Keyword fallback not sophisticated enough
   - May need to improve fallback quality

4. **Endpoint Configuration Authority**
   - Some endpoints may not be properly configured in `ConfigurationManager`
   - Missing or incorrect endpoint definitions

## Systematic Troubleshooting Plan

### **Phase 1: Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)**

1. **Fix High-Priority Endpoint Confusion** ‚ö° *IN PROGRESS*
   - **ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED**:
     - ‚úÖ Test was using hardcoded `/analyze` fallback instead of keyword routing results
     - ‚úÖ Test was using mock `queryAnalyzer` with terrible logic instead of real `EnhancedQueryAnalyzer`
     - ‚úÖ Mock was missing `getBestEndpoint()` method entirely
   - **REMAINING MYSTERY**: 
     - Debug script shows correct routing: "market share difference" ‚Üí `/competitive-analysis` ‚úÖ
     - Test still shows opposite: "market share difference" ‚Üí `/brand-difference` ‚ùå
     - **Suspicion**: Some environment difference between standalone vs test execution
   - **Current Status**: Same 13.6% routing accuracy, but now using real implementation

2. **Check Endpoint Configurations**
   - Verify all 22 endpoints are properly configured in `ConfigurationManager`
   - Ensure endpoint descriptions match expected routing
   - Validate keyword arrays are complete

### **Phase 2: Deep Investigation (Medium Effort)**

3. **Analyze Keyword Matching Logic**
   - Review `CachedEndpointRouter.suggestEndpoint()` method
   - Understand scoring algorithm and keyword weighting
   - Check for keyword conflict resolution

4. **Review Semantic vs Keyword Routing**
   - Test semantic routing accuracy in browser environment
   - Compare semantic vs keyword routing results
   - Determine if fallback logic is too aggressive

### **Phase 3: Enhancement (High Effort, High Impact)**

5. **Add Missing Keywords**
   - AI/ML terminology: "model", "algorithm", "prediction", "accuracy", "ensemble"
   - Business terms: "segment", "cluster", "persona", "outlier", "scenario"
   - Analytical concepts: "interaction", "correlation", "comparison"

6. **Improve Routing Logic**
   - Enhanced keyword scoring
   - Context-aware routing
   - Multi-keyword pattern matching

7. **Validate and Test**
   - Run comprehensive test after each improvement
   - Track routing accuracy improvements
   - Ensure no regressions in working queries

## Success Metrics

## Phase 1 Progress Summary (August 22, 2025)

### ‚úÖ **Completed:**
1. **Fixed Critical Test Bugs:**
   - ‚úÖ Removed hardcoded `/analyze` fallback
   - ‚úÖ Replaced broken mock `queryAnalyzer` with real `EnhancedQueryAnalyzer`
   - ‚úÖ Fixed duplicate import conflicts

2. **Enhanced `/feature-interactions` Routing:**
   - ‚úÖ Increased weight from 1.0 ‚Üí 1.3
   - ‚úÖ Added "interactions between" as primary keyword
   - ‚úÖ Added context keywords: "between demographics", "demographics and", "strongest interactions"
   - ‚úÖ **Result**: Standalone tests show 15.6 vs 8.0 score advantage over `/demographic-insights`

### üîç **Critical Mystery - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH:**
- **Routing Discrepancy CONFIRMED**: Test environment produces completely different results than standalone execution
- **Evidence**: AI/ML queries that route correctly standalone (16.0+ scores) fail in Jest environment
- **Examples**:
  - "most important factors predicting" ‚Üí Standalone: `/feature-importance-ranking` (16.0) | Jest: `/analyze`
  - "How accurate are our predictions" ‚Üí Standalone: `/model-performance` (15.6) | Jest: `/analyze`
  - "highest confidence ensemble" ‚Üí Standalone: `/ensemble-analysis` (23.4) | Jest: `/analyze`
- **Conclusion**: The issue is NOT missing keywords - it's a Jest environment problem

### üìà **Routing Accuracy Tracking:**
