- **Emerging Areas** (0-6): Development potential, higher risk

For each cluster:
- Size (number of areas)
- Average score
- Key characteristics

### 3.2 Correlations
Statistical relationships between scores and demographic factors:
- **Population Density**: Correlation with population size
- **Median Income**: Correlation with income levels
- **Other Factors**: As available in the dataset

Correlation strength indicators:
- **Strong**: >70% correlation
- **Moderate**: 40-70% correlation  
- **Weak**: <40% correlation

### 3.3 Geographic Trends
- **Geographic Concentration**: Clustering of high-performing areas
- **Score Clustering**: Tight grouping of similar scores
- **Trend Strength**: Strong, moderate, or weak patterns
- **Representative Areas**: Sample areas showing each trend
