# Customer Profile Endpoint Verification Checklist

## ✅ Endpoint Configuration
- [x] Added to ConfigurationManager with all required fields
- [x] Keywords configured for query detection
- [x] Target variable set: `customer_profile_score`
- [x] Response processor set: `CustomerProfileProcessor`
- [x] Default visualization: `cluster`
- [x] Validation rules defined

## ✅ Processor Implementation
- [x] CustomerProfileProcessor extends DataProcessorStrategy interface
- [x] Implements validate() method for data validation
- [x] Implements process() method for data processing
- [x] Returns ProcessedAnalysisData with correct structure
- [x] Sets targetVariable to `customer_profile_score`

## ✅ Direct Rendering Support
- [x] Implements createCustomerProfileRenderer() method
- [x] Implements createCustomerProfileLegend() method
- [x] Returns renderer and legend in ProcessedAnalysisData
- [x] Uses class-breaks renderer with quartile breaks
- [x] Color scheme: Purple → Blue → Teal → Green gradient
- [x] Legend positioned at bottom-right

## ✅ Data Flow Integration
- [x] CustomerProfileProcessor imported in DataProcessor.ts
- [x] Registered in initializeProcessors() method
- [x] Maps to `/customer-profile` endpoint

## ✅ Scoring Implementation
- [x] Created generate-customer-profile-scores.js script
- [x] Generates scores on 0-100 scale
- [x] Calculates 4 components with proper weights
- [x] Identifies 5 customer personas
- [x] Outputs to endpoints/customer-profile.json

## ✅ Multi-Endpoint Support
- [x] Keywords trigger multi-endpoint detection
- [x] Compatible with MultiEndpointAnalysisEngine
- [x] Can be combined with other endpoints

## ✅ Documentation
- [x] Added to endpoint-scoring-documentation.md
- [x] Created customer-profile-endpoint-specification.md
- [x] Added example queries to chat-constants.ts

## System Flow Alignment Summary

The customer-profile endpoint is **fully aligned** with the standard endpoint flow:

1. **Query Detection**: ConfigurationManager keywords trigger correct endpoint
2. **Data Processing**: CustomerProfileProcessor handles validation and processing
3. **Direct Rendering**: Bypasses complex rendering chain with direct renderer/legend
4. **Visualization**: Uses cluster visualization appropriate for persona segments
5. **Multi-Endpoint**: Can participate in multi-endpoint analyses

## Key Features Matching Other Endpoints

### Similar to Strategic Analysis:
- Pre-calculated scores in dataset
- 0-100 scale normalization
- Direct rendering implementation
- Component-based scoring

### Similar to Demographic Analysis:
- Persona/category identification
- Demographic data utilization
- Market context consideration

### Similar to Competitive Analysis:
- Market positioning assessment
- Brand affinity integration
- Multi-factor scoring

## No Additional Work Required

The customer-profile endpoint is fully integrated and follows all established patterns. No endpoint-specific prompts are needed as the system uses the ProcessedAnalysisData structure uniformly.
