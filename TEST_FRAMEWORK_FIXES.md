# Test Framework Fixes

## Problem Analysis

The original test framework was causing test-induced timeouts where Nike queries would complete in under 1 minute manually but timeout after 5 minutes in the test framework.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Over-Aggressive DOM Polling
- Old: Checked every 3 seconds with complex DOM queries
- New: Checks every 5 seconds with minimal queries
- Impact: Reduced DOM interference by 40%

### 2. Log Interception Interference
- Old: Hijacked console.log to buffer all logs
- New: No log interception, passive observation only
- Impact: Eliminated potential debugging interference

### 3. Complex Processing Detection
- Old: 15+ different selectors checked constantly
- New: 3 simple, definitive indicators only
- Impact: Reduced false positives and processing conflicts

## Files Created

- test-geospatial-chat-comprehensive-fixed.js - New lightweight framework
- COMPREHENSIVE_GEOSPATIAL_CHAT_TEST_PLAN.md - Detailed testing guide

## Usage

Load the fixed framework in browser console, then run:
- geoTester.runSingleTest('nike')
- geoTester.runAllTests()

The new framework should complete Nike tests in 30-60 seconds without interference.
