# Memory Leak Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was crashing on the second query after clearing the first. Browser refreshing was required to continue using the app.

## Root Cause
The `CachedEndpointRouter` was storing datasets in memory via `cachedDatasets` Map and never clearing them between queries. Large datasets (like customer-profile at 10.76 MB) were accumulating in memory.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AnalysisEngine.clearAnalysis()
- Added `this.endpointRouter.clearCache()` to clear cached datasets
- Added `this.visualizationRenderer.clearEffects()` to clear visualization effects
- Added memory usage logging for debugging

### 2. Modified handleSubmit in geospatial-chat-interface.tsx
- Added `clearAnalysis()` call at the start of each new query
- This ensures cached data is cleared before starting new analysis

### 3. Existing Layer Cleanup (Already in place)
- Layer destruction via `.destroy()` method
- Graphics clearing via `graphics.removeAll()`
- Proper layer removal from map

## Code Changes

### /lib/analysis/AnalysisEngine.ts
```typescript
clearAnalysis(): void {
  // Clear cached datasets to prevent memory leaks
  const cacheStatus = this.endpointRouter.getCacheStatus();
  console.log('[AnalysisEngine] Clearing cache with status:', cacheStatus);
  this.endpointRouter.clearCache();
  
  // Clear visualization effects and resources
  this.visualizationRenderer.clearEffects();
  
  // Log memory usage if available (Chrome only)
  if (performance.memory) {
    const used = Math.round(performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize / 1048576);
    const total = Math.round(performance.memory.totalJSHeapSize / 1048576);
    console.log(`[AnalysisEngine] Memory after cache clear: ${used}MB / ${total}MB`);
  }
  
  // ... rest of state clearing
}
```

### /components/geospatial-chat-interface.tsx
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (query: string, source: 'main' | 'reply' = 'main') => {
  // --- STATE RESET (same as original) ---
  setIsProcessing(true);
  setError(null);
  setProcessingError(null);
  setFeatures([]);
  setFormattedLegendData({ items: [] });
  
  // Clear cached datasets to prevent memory leaks
  clearAnalysis();
  
  // ... rest of function
}
```

## Memory Cleared

1. **CachedEndpointRouter datasets** - Large JSON datasets (up to 10+ MB each)
2. **VisualizationRenderer effects** - Canvas elements, animations, WebGL resources
3. **ArcGIS layers** - FeatureLayer instances with destroy() method
4. **Graphics collections** - Map graphics and overlays

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Run first query (e.g., "Strategic analysis for Nike expansion")
2. Clear visualization when complete
3. Run second query with different endpoint (e.g., "Customer profile analysis")
4. Check browser console for cache clearing logs and memory usage
5. Verify no crash occurs on second query

The console should show logs like:
```
[AnalysisEngine] Clearing cache with status: {loadedEndpoints: ['strategic-analysis'], memoryUsage: 1}
[CachedEndpointRouter] Cache cleared
[AnalysisEngine] Memory after cache clear: 245MB / 512MB
```

## Preventive Measures

- Memory usage monitoring in Chrome DevTools (Performance tab)
- Cache status logging for debugging
- Proactive clearing on every new query (not just on errors)
- Visualization effects cleanup to prevent WebGL memory leaks

This fix should resolve the second query crash without requiring page refresh.
