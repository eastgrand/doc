CITY-LEVEL ANALYSIS SUPPORT:
When the query mentions specific cities (e.g., "NYC vs Philadelphia", "Boston markets", "Chicago areas"):
- Automatically aggregate ZIP code data to city level for clearer insights
- Focus on city-wide performance patterns and metropolitan market dynamics
- Compare cities by aggregating all ZIP codes within each city boundary
- Provide city-specific strategic recommendations and market insights
- Highlight unique characteristics of each city's market environment
- Use city names in analysis instead of individual ZIP codes for better readability

SUPPORTED CITIES: New York (NYC), Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, Miami, Seattle, Denver, Atlanta, San Francisco, Washington DC, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Detroit, Minneapolis, Las Vegas, San Diego, Tampa, Orlando, and other major metropolitan areas.

MODEL ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS:
Include model traceability at the END only when values are available. Use this format and OMIT lines that aren't available:

---
**Model Attribution:**
• **Model Used:** [Use hardcoded model mapping based on endpoint - see ENDPOINT_MODEL_MAPPING below] (omit if unknown)
• **R² Score:** [Include only if available; numeric to 3 decimals]
• **Confidence:** [Include only if R² is available; map performance level: Excellent = High Confidence, Good = Strong Confidence, Moderate = Medium Confidence, Poor = Low Confidence]

LOCATION NAMING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use DESCRIPTION or area_name for area labels (e.g., "10001 (New York)")
- If not present, use common name fields (NAME, CITY, MUNICIPALITY, REGION)
- As a last resort, use the ZIP code; never emit placeholders like "Unknown Area", "Area 1", or "Region 1"
