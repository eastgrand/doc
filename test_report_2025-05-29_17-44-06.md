## Production Test Compliance

The tests verify compliance with the following production testing requirements:

### Critical Requirements
- [x] Tests use real production data and live service endpoints
- [x] No mocking or dummy data in production testing
- [x] All layer URLs are actual ArcGIS service endpoints
- [x] All spatial queries are executed against real feature services
- [x] Performance metrics are measured with actual data volumes
- [x] Network conditions are tested in real-world scenarios

### Data Requirements
- [x] Using actual demographic data from production services
- [x] Testing with real business location data
- [x] Verifying against live spending and psychographic datasets
- [x] All layer configurations match production settings
- [x] Feature counts and geometries match production data

### Issues and Recommendations

The following issues were identified during testing:

1. **Performance Optimization Needed**
   - Large datasets cause rendering delays in certain visualization types
   - Recommendation: Implement additional feature reduction strategies

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Some network errors are not properly handled in the SHAP microservice integration
   - Recommendation: Add more robust error recovery mechanisms

3. **Layer Management Enhancements**
   - Layer sharing capabilities need to be implemented
   - Recommendation: Prioritize this feature for the next sprint

## Next Steps

1. Address the identified issues and implement recommendations
2. Expand test coverage for:
   - Spatial Query Tests
   - Layer Sharing Tests
   - Performance Tests
   - Error Handling Tests
3. Automate the test suite for continuous integration
