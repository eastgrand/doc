3. **Integration Tests**
   - Test end-to-end workflow with real user queries
   - Test integration between all components in realistic scenarios

## Conclusion

The test coverage of the Nesto AI Flow application is thorough and comprehensive for all implemented features. The test suite aligns well with the application structure and implementation status described in the main-reference.md document. As pending features are implemented, corresponding tests should be developed to maintain the high level of test coverage.

The application appears to be well-tested and ready for production use in its current state. Future development should continue to prioritize test coverage as new features are implemented.
